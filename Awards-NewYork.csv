While machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized our ability to process large data sets and infer patterns within them. Algorithmic advances in ML and AI have created entirely new sectors of the economy and have the potential for myriad societal benefits. However, natural systems remain more adept at interacting with the world compared to artificial ones. Moreover, they do so with considerably less processing and energetic constraints. The guiding principle of this conference is that insights from neuroscience are vital for designing the next generation of AI and ML systems. This meeting will assemble an international gathering of scientists from both AI and neuroscience disciplines. Participants will be drawn from academic centers, research institutes and industrial centers and will include leaders in the field, established investigators, junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students. This broad representation will enable excellent coverage of the scientific topics while providing opportunities for synergistic interactions among the participants. The intimate and informal setting will promote  community-level  discussion  of  challenges  and  opportunities  for  the  field. The results of this project will achieve broad impact by identifying new and facile approaches to draw from insights into brain function to design ML and AI algorithms. Invited workshop participants will include a very diverse range of participants in order to achieve diversity across a number of dimensions, including faculty rank, gender, underrepresented groups and institutional diversity. This approach will facilitate the scientific and professional development of early career researchers as well as the inclusion of scientists from traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The workshop will bring together research leaders across diverse disciplines for intensive discussions aimed at leveraging insights from neuroscience to design the next generation of machine learning and artificially intelligent systems. This meeting will focus on the most successful examples of unification and seek to explore their basis and generalization. The meeting will identify tools, models and theories from biology, evolution and neuroscience that can be used to catalyze new designs of artificially intelligent systems that can potentially be as adept as natural ones. This activity is consistent with the National Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan, which identifies as its first strategic objective the need to make long-term investments in AI research in areas with the potential for long-term payoffs in AI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project is focused on understanding the interplay between ascending and descending (feedback) activity patterns in the olfactory system of behaving mice. Here, the investigator does not simply focus on the olfactory sensory module that integrates and transmits information from the nose to the brain but determines how higher brain areas, namely, the olfactory cortex, interact in the recurrent processing loop. This strategy enables the investigator to evaluate how sensory inputs are shaped by internal brain states via feedback. Furthermore, the investigator works at the interface of two approaches by combining cutting-edge experimental approaches--optical imaging and optogenetic strategies-- with novel computational models that give rise to non-mutually exclusive testable predictions. The investigator determines whether these feedforward-feedback loops contribute to attention states, extraction of odor identity, or broadcasting of predictions and error signals related to the incoming odorants. Experimental techniques are complemented, through an international collaboration, with state-of-the-art data analysis that characterizes neuronal population dynamics along high-dimensional trajectories and measures occurrence of activity patterns, characteristic timescales, patterns interaction, and coordination as a function of behavior. Additionally, the project provides opportunities for students and postdoctoral trainees from the USA and Romania to expand their experimental and computational skills through their participation in the international collaboration.<br/><br/>A central goal of systems neuroscience is to describe behaviors in terms of the neuronal circuits that control them. This constitutes a steep challenge in the mammalian brain, because behaviors are thought to rely on widely distributed feedforward, as well as top-down feedback neural representations, which are technically difficult to monitor at large scales and manipulate at cellular resolution. The project builds on recent experimental results from the lead investigator and novel algorithms for odor identification developed by the international collaborator. Specifically, the project probes the fine structure of olfactory perception and tests the central hypothesis that feedback serves one or more of the following three mechanisms: predictive coding, attractor generation, or attention to enhance the discriminability of behaviorally relevant stimuli. The dynamics of: a) cortical-bulbar feedback, and b) olfactory bulb output neurons on which feedback acts indirectly via interneurons are monitored and subsequently modulated with cellular resolution in mice engaged in olfactory discrimination forced-choice tasks and contextual reversal learning tasks. Reversible optogenetic local suppression of cortical feedback in the olfactory bulb is combined with simultaneous two-photon resonant scanning imaging (100 Hz) of hundreds of neurons. To address the proposed feedback roles, specific experimental design is combined with machine learning tools and dynamical systems analysis."

This project is aimed at characterizing how we build our sense of self, by using multisite brain recordings and virtual reality technologies.  The results will impact national needs in the consumer, healthcare, military, and industrial settings by advancing the fundamental engineering and neuroscience knowledge necessary to create the next generation of brain-machine interfaces, which are envisioned to support the integration of artificial and natural sensory information.  Optimizing these systems depends critically on understanding how natural sensory signals interact within and among brain areas, a knowledge gap that directly addressed by this project.  The educational goals associated with the project are designed to advance discovery and understanding of engineering and neuroscience, while also promoting teaching, training, and learning beyond the regular bounds of these disciplines. These goals are achieved by: 1) Engaging high school students underrepresented in STEM fields through the development of hands-on instructional modules, 2) Promoting interdisciplinary undergraduate research opportunities via internships at Arizona State University, 3) Mentoring students in the broader implications of scientific research through exposure to organizations engaged in the ethical, societal, and policy implications of neuroscience research, and 4) Engaging the public in scientific discourse through public lectures and exhibits, and thereby promoting broad dissemination of the work to enhance scientific and technological understanding.<br/><br/>Estimating the state of the body through the integration of available sensory cues (multimodal state estimation) is a critical integrative function for most organisms.  Although much is known about state estimation for the upper limb at the behavioral level, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood in cortical areas, particularly at the network level.  This is due to several factors: 1) the cortical areas believed to play a role in limb state estimation are heterogenous with regard to the relative strength of their sensory inputs and display both multisensory enhancement and suppression depending on context; 2) technical limitations mean functional interactions among these areas have been challenging to characterize; 3) the relation between sensitivity to visual and somatic cues and prevailing computational theories of multisensory integration have been incompletely explored; 4) multimodal areas are thought to contribute to both perceptual and action-based body representations but how these representations interact at the neural and behavioral levels is not well understood.  As a result, it is unclear how a coherent multimodal estimate of the state of the upper limb is constructed and maintained.  The proposed series of studies address these issues by quantifying changes in neural spiking, local field potentials, and neural coherence within and among fronto-parietal areas of the monkey implicated in state estimation using virtual reaching tasks that alter the reliability and semantic information of visual cues."

How cells self-organize into complex tissues is one of the greatest puzzles in modern developmental biology and a hallmark example of emergent behavior - complex patterns arising from simpler interacting components. Despite tremendous progress, even the best-studied model systems lack an understanding of the emergent properties that bridge developmental phenomena from molecules to cells, tissues, and eventually complete organisms. Biofilms formed by the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus are a great model system to study emergent behavior. Under starvation, an M. xanthus biofilm initiates a developmental program during which cells aggregate into mounds and then differentiate into distinct cell types. Many of the genes that influence M. xanthus development have been identified, but researchers lack metrics to systematically understand their role in coordinating self-organization dynamics. This project aims to link genes and emergent behavior through machine-learning-based quantification of the developmental impact of gene disruptions. The methodology developed in this project is expected to be broadly applicable. Broader impacts of the proposal will be further enhanced by training opportunities for students for all participating laboratories, facilitated by close interactions such as joint meetings and trainee collaborations. Furthermore, project outreach will include collaborative efforts to bring 3D-printed microscopes into AP Biology high school classrooms. <br/><br/>Connecting genotypes to emergent multicellular phenotypes is one of the grand challenges of 21st century biology. The lack of robust metrics that quantify the effects of genetic perturbations on emergent patterns significantly impedes our ability to make progress even for relatively simple model systems such as Myxococcus xanthus. Three major problems exist: (1) individual cell movements are inherently stochastic, and their collective emergent patterns display significant variations between experimental replicates; (2) emergent patterns displayed during development are unpredictable and extremely sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions; (3) developmental phenotypes of mutant strains are often subtle and difficult to characterize and quantify. Until these problems are addressed, it may be difficult to separate the phenotypic impact of mutation from the effects of stochasticity and environmental sensitivity. Notably, these problems are not unique to M. xanthus, and therefore their solution has the potential to be transformative across many different biological systems that display emergent multicellular behaviors. Recent advances in application of deep learning in computer vision have demonstrated the power of these approaches to deal with similar problems. Therefore, developed approaches are expected to apply to a wide range of model systems, just as deep-learning-based image quantification methods are being applied to a vast array of images from a variety of fields.<br/><br/>This work is jointly funded by Integrated Organismal Systems (IOS), Molecular Cell Biology (MCB) and the Rules of Life (RoL) venture fund.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Joseph Gage is ""The Genomic Basis for Dysregulation of Protein Abundance in Maize"" The host institutions for the fellowship are Cornell University and Washington University and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Edward S. Buckler and Richard Vierstra.<br/><br/>DNA sequences get translated into proteins, which are important components in determining an organism's size, shape, and health.  Small differences in DNA sequence can cause large changes in how much of the resulting protein is made, but little is known about how those changes in DNA sequence affect protein quantity.  To learn more about the relationship between DNA sequence and protein quantity, this research will measure the abundance of thousands of different proteins produced by twenty-seven diverse varieties of maize (corn). Genome sequences as well as gene expression levels will be used to learn how differences in DNA sequence result in differing amounts of protein. The data generated will be used to build machine learning models that can predict protein abundance from DNA sequence alone.  The findings from this study will provide new insights into how complex traits (like an organism's size, shape, or health) are controlled by differences in DNA sequence spread throughout the genome.  Broader impacts include mentoring and training undergraduate and graduate students as well as participating in the Skype-A-Scientist program (https://skypeascientist.com) which pairs scientists in various STEM disciplines with classrooms of children for question and answer sessions. Training objectives include obtaining expertise in bioinformatics, molecular genetics, proteomics, transcriptomics, application of machine learning, and functional genomics. <br/><br/>Proteins are a crucial determinant of phenotype. As the ultimate step in the central dogma of molecular biology, their presence and abundance determine phenotypic state. To date, there are no published studies of proteomic variability between genetically diverse members of an economic important crop  plant species. This project seeks to develop a model of how rare and deleterious alleles cause dysregulation of protein abundance by affecting translation, transport, and degradation via changes to protein structure and function in maize.  This research will break new ground in maize functional genomics and proteomics by integrating pre-existing genomic data with newly generated time-series transcriptomic data and proteomic characterization of twenty-seven diverse maize inbred lines to generate a multi-omic dataset that captures all three levels of the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA, RNA, and protein. Since genomic variants can affect protein abundance by dysregulation of either transcription, translation, or both, transcript and protein abundance will be used together to assess specifically how genetic variants impact translation on a genome-wide scale. Genetic variants with influential effects on translation will be identified and characterized for their effects on protein secondary structure, solvent accessibility, contact between residues, and intrinsic disorder. These features will be used to formulate an overarching model to describe the influence of rare and deleterious variants on protein abundance. All proteomic and transcriptomic data generated for the twenty-seven diverse maize inbred lines will be useful for other projects and researchers, and for that reason, it is important that all data be as accessible and organized as possible. Raw reads from 3? RNA sequencing will be deposited on the NCBI-SRA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), and the raw mass spectra from proteomic assays will be made available on the ProteomeXchange database (http://www.proteomexchange.org/).

Historically, behavioral adaptation has played a central role in the progression of epidemics. In some cases, a change in behavior may suppress an epidemic (e.g., through fear-driven flight or self-isolation) while in other cases, a change may intensify the spread of a disease (e.g., through vaccine refusal or premature cessation of distancing). People?s future behavior during the current COVID-19 epidemic will determine how well we cope with two central threats. First is the immediate threat of successive epidemic waves due to the premature lifting of social distancing guidelines, and the abandonment of social distancing by a large percentage of the population. The second threat is that the disease will rebound even after a vaccine is available. This has occurred before (e.g., measles) and could occur with COVID-19 if a sufficient fraction of the population refuses vaccine out of fear. This research will develop a new model to predict human behavior using publicly available social media data to address a known weakness in most current models.  The new model, source code, data, parameters, assumptions, and methods will all be completely open and publicly available, ensuring the replicability of all results. This project will also deliver an interactive version of the model for use by policymakers, government agencies, and educators. Other broader impacts are training opportunities for a graduate student. <br/><br/>Most current models that are used to forecast the course of epidemics may provide incomplete results because they do not take into account changes in peoples? behavior (human behavioral adaptation).  In the proposed research, human behavior will be included within a new model using data taken from social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. The data will allow calibration of the model and replicate the entire New York State epidemic to date.

The project team will sample and analyze the worldwide spectrum of genetic diversity in Andropogoneae to develop detailed models testing whether (1) quantitative estimates of evolutionary constraint improve predictions of fitness-related traits, and (2) convergent environmental adaptations shared across the Andropogoneae explain a substantial proportion of total adaptive variance.

Because biodiversity is essential to the health of the planet, it is important to understand how it is generated, maintained and lost. This topic, however, is extraordinarily complex. Biodiversity distribution patterns and ecosystem services are regulated by processes that operate across multiple hierarchical levels of organization, temporal dimensions, and spatial scales. This Research Coordination Network brings together a diverse set of researchers to integrate data and explore novel concepts that will rapidly advance the field. Researchers will explicitly investigate processes that span hierarchical levels to identify novel properties that could not have been predicted by investigating the individual parts alone. Biologists working at different scales of organization will lead the effort, in coordination with researchers with expertise in machine learning, modeling, and mathematics to ensure the required cyberinfrastructure will advance in sync with new biodiversity and ecological forecasting theory. Annual meetings and workshops will offer diverse training opportunities in biodiversity informatics and scientific communication to students and faculty. The network will establish student research immersion opportunities and extensive cross-disciplinary training through exchanges among biodiversity, environmental biology, and computer sciences laboratories at the collaborating institutions. Based on participant feedback, the Research Coordination Network will adapt best student-centric practices of collaborative research, and report them to the scientific community. Envisioned products include perspective, synthetic, proof-of-concept, and data-driven publications, and presentations at scientific meetings, webinars, and learning modules.

Researchers will also examine the theoretical consequences of these predictions using mathematical models, to understand how disease patterns are most likely to change over time. Instead of reacting to new diseases after they have emerged, the predictions and methodological advances developed in this project will immediately benefit society by informing us how future disease threats may be preempted.<br/><br/>By combining machine learning and mathematical modeling with growing volumes of data on infectious diseases in wildlife and humans, this project will: (1) Identify intrinsic traits of hosts and pathogens and general environmental features that best predict patterns of zoonotic infection; (2) Identify particular mammal species and pathogenic agents likely to be undiscovered sources of future zoonoses; (3) Investigate the host, pathogen, and environmental covariates that distinguish infection from zoonotic disease in humans, and that combine to predict outbreak size; (4) Fit mathematical models (theory) to empirically observed patterns to derive potential underlying processes; (5) Investigate paradigmatic eco-epidemiological mechanisms through which empirically observed traits of hosts, pathogens, and changing environments influence transmission processes and disease dynamics."

The RoLE model will apply new techniques in machine learning to fit models to high dimensional, cross-scale data. The model will simulate eco-evolutionary community assembly building from individual-based ecological and genetic neutral models with added non-neutral, trait-based competition and environmental filtering. New species and traits will arise through long time scale evolution in the meta-community and rapid evolution in the local community. Population genetics and species abundances in the local community will be modeled through birth, death, immigration, and mutation. The project research team will refine and illustrate the use of the RoLE model by testing four hypothesized rules of life across three bio-geographic systems for which multi-scale biodiversity data are now available. The hypotheses address the relative roles of immigration versus speciation in community assembly, how species interactions influence diversity, how different assembly histories determine the strength of species interactions, and whether/how systems come to equilibrium. The project leaders have established a network of 14 collaborators, including the National Ecological Observatory Network, who will use the RoLE model in their diverse systems and propagate wider adoption. In order to further reduce barriers to use, the RoLE model framework will be made available as open source software, including an R language Shiny App interface with standardized metadata outputs to promote reproducibility and sharing. The insights gained from the RoLE model are of direct relevance to conservation, e.g., whether or not communities are assembled primarily by speciation or immigration strongly determines their response to anthropogenic pressures and optimal conservation management. To encourage participation in quantitative biodiversity research, the project leaders will develop a massively open online course through the Santa Fe Institute?s Complexity Explorer program using the RoLE model as an interactive teaching tool. In conjunction with Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, the research team will also provide an in-person data science training workshop.

Many questions about these interconnected networks are unanswered: How variable are they from individual to individual, how do they change throughout life, how does the environment impact on them, and what are the genetic blueprints that generate these networks. Disruptions of the genetic blueprints that build neuronal networks are the likely cause of many human neurological diseases. In order to study neuronal networks in the brain, it is of paramount interest to easily visualize the patterns of connectivity of neurons, ideally in the context of live organisms. The cellular complexity of brains prevents such types of studies in complex organisms, and this project therefore uses a simple invertebrate model system, the nematode C.elegans, to visualize all the major neuronal connections of its simple nervous system. Previous studies have amply demonstrated that mechanisms of brain patterning discovered in C.elegans are conserved in other animals as well.  The investigators develop and use cutting-edge fluorescent reporter technology, combined with microscopical and computer vision technology to achieve this goal. The project's construction of animals in which most neuronal connections are fluorescently labeled provides a major resource. This resource is made available to the large field of C.elegans researchers who with that resource can study the many questions that relate to circuits in the brain, including the decoding of the nervous system's genetic blueprint. In addition, the project includes cutting-edge, interdisciplinary training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds, as well as postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>The project entails the development and dissemination of tools that empower the C.elegans neuroscience community to study the connectome of the nematode C.elegans. In the first phase, the technology hub develops two sets of tools: One group uses fluorescent-based reporter technology (GRASP and iBlinc as potential alternative) to generate a large number of transgenic C.elegans strains in which the main ""edges"" of the entire wiring diagram (i.e., pairwise combinations of neurons) are visualized. As part of this project, this resource is distributed throughout the C.elegans community to enable labs with long-standing interest in various aspects of neuronal development and function and with a focus on specific neuronal circuits and behaviors to use these synaptic labels to examine variability, development, and plasticity of these connections. In parallel, the other group develops microfluidic-based and automated image analysis technologies to precisely quantify the structure of the connectome and to enable high-throughput screening of worm population for defects in synaptic wiring. Computer vision and machine learning is used to score automatically disruptions of synaptic wiring to detect subtle changes in wiring.

The ability of maize to produce and grow robustly is dependent on growth centers within the plant known as meristems. This study examines two meristem types in detail -- the inflorescence meristem, which ultimately produces all the edible grain, and the root meristem, which forages nutrients and water from the soil. While these meristems are located at opposite ends of the plant, they express many of the same genes and share functional properties. This project takes advantage of new techniques, developed in medical research, called single-cell RNA-sequencing that can dissect an entire organ, like a meristem, one cell at a time, to find which genes are active in a given cell. After such cell-by-cell analysis in root and shoot meristems, the project will use computational techniques to reconstruct each meristem from individual cells, like assembling a tile mosaic. The project will use another set of computational techniques to identify common aspects of gene regulation among cells of the different meristems, analogous to finding common patterns across mosaics. In biological terms, these common patterns represent a core, conserved set of functions that control important traits such as growth. Knowledge of such core gene regulators could be used by breeders to improve traits like grain yield in the shoot and drought resistance in the root. The project will also train junior researchers in these emerging techniques.<br/><br/>Root and shoot meristems are traditionally studied separately, but aspects of their organization are in fact similar. In both root and shoot meristems, pluripotent stem cells signal back and forth with 'organizer' cells (the quiescent center in the root and the organizing center in the shoot) within the stem cell niche. In addition, they share a number of common or paralogous gene regulators. The premise of the project is that a detailed dissection of shoot and root meristems will identify key shared components that control meristem organization and maintenance. In addition, while forward genetics has uncovered many key regulators, genetic redundancy has been a barrier to a more comprehensive understanding of meristems. The project takes advantage of advances in single-cell RNA-seq that now permit a cell-by-cell reconstruction of several different types of shoot and root meristems. A computational analysis will be employed to map equivalent cells among the meristems using the MetaNeighbor approach, accounting for potentially paralogous genes with homologous function across meristems. Machine learning approaches will be used to generate models of the genetic circuitry shared across many or a subset of meristems. The goal is to identify common circuits (and their potentially redundant components) across meristems that could represent a core circuitry needed for the maintenance of meristems. CRISPR knockouts will then be used to test the models of core meristem circuitry, addressing redundancy with guideRNA constructs that target multiple paralogs at once.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its widespread use, a basic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie successful graft combinations is lacking, making it impossible to precisely predict beneficial graft combinations. Research conducted on this project will help elucidate the mechanisms that underlie communication between grafted root and shoot systems. Progress in this area has the potential to transform the practice of grafting into a more precise science, enabling scientists and farmers to rapidly adapt crops to combat new diseases, handle environmental fluctuations, and restructure growth habits for improved crop productivity. In addition to providing research training for undergraduate students, graduate students, and a postdoctoral researcher, the project will emphasize science communication, and students will help design and host public workshops on plant grafting. Related undergraduate training will be offered through the implementation of a novel visual and experiential learning pedagogy, based on 3-dimensional X-ray imaging and other hands-on image capture activities, for Cornell?s introductory undergraduate botany course. <br/><br/>Long-distance signaling is known to play a fundamental role in the growth and stress response mechanisms in plants, as well as related processes including grafting, and thus is critical from an agricultural point of view. Unfortunately, the processes underlying these signaling pathways remain poorly understood, even at the most basic level. A prime example involves the role of mRNAs in long-distance signaling, which until recently were assumed to function almost exclusively within the cells where they are produced. However, new studies that rely on polymorphism-based detection of mobile transcripts between heterografted root and shoot systems demonstrate that a large number of distinct RNA species move across distant organ systems. The potential significance of this plant ?mobileome? is a heavily debated topic, with widespread disagreement over whether mobile RNAs represent a collection of long-distance signals or are simply noise in the vascular system. Much of this controversy is due to the lack of fundamental knowledge about how the plant mobileome works. The research objectives of this proposal are: 1) to resolve the fundamental question of whether mRNAs play a crucial role in long-distance signaling and grafting; 2) to more generally explore the mobility of mRNA in plants; and 3) to further our understanding of the mechanisms of transport as a means to realize the long-term goal of engineering and deploying artificial mRNAs to confer agriculturally desirable traits. These goals will be achieved through the production of novel genomic resources, and the use of temporal sampling, computational genomics, and high-resolution, in vivo RNA imaging, which will ultimately provide insight into the dynamic behavior of long-distance RNA movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central problem in understanding the origin of the human brain concerns the role of social life and the demands it places on the brain to generate adaptive behavior.  As humans evolved complex societies, it is thought that the brain increased in volume to enable advanced cognition.  Social insects are outstanding models to examine brain evolution in light of social complexity.  This research project employs ants as an ideal model system to analyze the relationship between sociality and brain evolution because different species form colonies that vary in size and the degree of complexity.  This research will also help us understand how exceptionally small brains are able to process complex social information.  The project will analyze differences in the size and organization of worker brains, and their metabolic costs to determine if complex social life has increased the efficiency of energy use in the brain.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate who will become skilled in designing scientific studies and will acquire techniques that enable brains to be imaged.  Students will also learn data analysis, and scientific writing and publication. The researchers will develop a curriculum to enrich the education of K-12 students by introducing them to the study of behavior and neuroscience.  The researchers will recruit diverse participants from the Laboratory Schools of the University of Chicago to encourage minority students to become activity engaged in science. The project will broadly support science outreach in the Chicago STEM Pipeline, Arizona Assurance, Brain Awareness, and Boston Upward Bound programs to address the critical national need to improve science education and train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>To determine how social complexity has influenced brain evolution, the researchers will quantify neuronal metabolic requirements, neuropil investment and scaling, behavioral plasticity, and synaptic organization in brain regions considered key to cognitive function.  Pairs of species representative of major ant subfamilies that accentuate variability in social complexity will form the sample groups.  The researchers will: 1) quantify energetic requirements of functionally specialized neuropil using cytochrome oxidase staining to assess ATP use; 2) determine if brain development is experience-dependent; 3) quantify synaptic complexes associated with cognition; and 4) couple behavioral performance with neural and metabolic metrics.  The researchers will determine neuron number and size and variation in peripheral sensory structures, and examine brain compartment scaling patterns.  Controlling for phylogeny, analyses infer how independent evolutionary events associated with collective intelligence shaped brain evolution. All original images will be freely available upon publication, in the absence of copyright issues.  Organismal data (specimen and colony collection data, phenotypic data, etc.) will be maintained in individual labs, and will be made freely available upon request.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Biological nitrogen fixation is the process of converting nitrogen gas to nitrogen that is used by the majority of organisms on Earth. Nitrogen fixation is accomplished by bacteria. Plant-associated bacteria (called rhizobia) are responsible for fixing 100 million metric tons of nitrogen in nature, and provide a critical ecosystem service. However, anthropogenic nitrogen inputs have the potential to change this bacteria-plant relationship. The fellow will use historical museum specimens to understand how increases in environmental nitrogen have changed the relationship between plants andplant-associated nitrogen fixation bacteria. The fellow will focus on Legumes and their rhizobia because these plants are important for ecosystem health and function. In areas with high nitrogen deposition, legumes decrease in frequency and are at risk for extinction. This project will better describe the legume-rhizobia relationship in environments with high nitrogen conditions and potentially illuminate conservation strategies and ways to preserve critical ecosystem functions.<br/><br/>This project will incorporate biological collections to achieve two main objectives: 1) To conduct population genomic analyses across space and time to identify regions of host and symbiont genomes under selection and test whether anthropogenic nitrogen increase alters these patterns. 2) To use revived historical germplasm to experimentally test if there is evidence for antagonistic coevolution between host and symbiont in high nitrogen environments. This work will be done using contemporary and historical collections of legume species, Medicago lupulina and their rhizobial symbionts, Ensifer meliloti, that will be isolated from the roots of contemporary and historical plant specimens. Biological collections are an untapped resource for studying historical patterns of coevolution and as a source of material to perform manipulative experiments to better understand coevolutionary patterns. Collections can effectively act as a ""time machine"" allowing us a glimpse at the trajectory of coevolution in the Anthropocene. Broader impacts of this project include the development of protocols that allow researchers to revive historical bacteria. These protocols will be made publicly available and revolutionize the types of questions researchers can ask about mutualistic coevolution. The fellow will also develop active learning exercises about coevolution. Active learning is an incredibly effective pedagogical technique and one that leads to better learning outcomes for women and underrepresented groups in the classroom, and thus is one force that can be employed to level the playing field in academics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While a technological revolution in systems neuroscience yielded a broad array of tools to observe and manipulate neural circuits, behavioral technologies have lagged behind. The problem of behavioral measurement and description is as complex as behaviors are diverse. To study behavior, laboratories employ complex behavioral systems, often in combination with custom-made hardware and software, and use these to define the tasks animals are required to learn and perform. As a consequence, the descriptions of behavioral tasks are tied to the hardware of each system, and there is no general, abstract description format to bridge across laboratories employing different systems. Building on insights from computer science, computational linguistics, and psychology, the goal of this project is to develop a formal language to describe behavioral tasks. This new behavioral task description language enhances accurate task design, improves reproducibility of existing tasks, enables widespread sharing and publication of task descriptions, and supports cross-system implementation. The project has broad benefits for improving scientific rigor and reproducibility in behavioral neuroscience. Moreover, the project reduces a significant barrier to sophisticated behavioral neuroscience experiments, putting them within reach of undergraduate class projects, and exposing students to a highly interdisciplinary approach, drawing on neuroscience, computer science, psychology, and linguistics.<br/> <br/>The project entails the development of a formal computer language that can describe all laboratory behavioral tasks in a platform-independent manner. Currently, behavioral tasks are described largely with a combination of flowcharts and textual explanation, beyond the specific software codes used to control behavioral hardware. These descriptions do not provide formal accounts that ensure identical re-implementation or the rigorous comparison of similarly described paradigms. In addition, the hardware-bound codes tend hide the logic of behavioral tasks. The objective of this project is to design a new language, an extension to finite state machine descriptions, that can serve both as abstract illustrations for publications and also ready-to-run programs to control hardware. The new behavioral task description language builds on the class virtual finite state machines, a finite state machine extension framework that was developed to provide software specifications for real-time control systems. Additionally, the new task description language introduces ways to encapsulate common design motifs so they can be treated as primitives and additional features to define trial structures. The consistent high-level description enhances behavioral task design, distilling critical features into an easy-to-understand and formally rigorous structure. To demonstrate the use of this language, a turn-key implementation, including a graphical editor, is produced. In addition, templates for an array of commonly used behavioral tasks are produced. The platform-independent behavior description language exposes the underlying behavioral task logic and makes it easier to describe, reproduce, and share behavioral tasks across laboratories.

Proteins often must change their shape in order to do their work. How certain proteins can change shape so efficiently, and why others cannot, is not known.  A possible answer lies in vibrations of these molecules. This project provides necessary data to improve calculations to predict protein shape changes. The work uses a unique experimental setup to measure protein vibrations, as well as a collaborative approach to improve the predictive power of calculations based on the experimental measurements.  The research will train graduate students and undergraduates in interdisciplinary research (optical physics, molecular biology, materials science and computational chemistry). In addition, a large number of undergraduates and high school students will participate in experiential learning, with hands-on measurements and calculations on proteins that respond to light such as light harvesting proteins involved in photosynthesis.  To increase international and cultural awareness, students, supported by a collaborator in Mexico, will participate in the research and produce instructional media in Spanish.<br/>  <br/>The researchers will investigate the role of intramolecular motions in protein function by applying a unique tool developed to directly measure protein intramolecular vibrational motions: anisotropy terahertz microscopy (ATM). The work will focus on several bench marking proteins which have been extensively studied by other techniques to characterize structure and dynamics. Combined with molecular modeling, ATM measurements of photoactive yellow protein (PYP), chicken egg white lysozyme (CEWL) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and their mutants will identify long range structural motions that impact function. The measurements on PYP will examine if vibrations within the protein backbone enhance chromophore isomerization for photoactive proteins, such as light sensing protein in the eye, rhodopsin.   The proposed measurements will determine if collective vibrations overlap the oscillations of the PYP chromophore, and if photocycling is impacted by detuning the frequencies. The measurements will also examine if remote mutations of CEWL and DHFR affect catalytic rates by perturbing the intramolecular dynamics. The PI and co-PI will refine approaches for calculating the isotropic and anisotropic terahertz absorbance of protein solutions and crystals, and develop methods for analysis of the motions corresponding to the observed resonances."

This knowledge will contribute to the field of bacterial ecology.  This knowledge will also contribute to many areas of biotechnology.  For example, engineering bacteria that are capable of specific adaptive responses is important for waste remediation, metabolic engineering, and bacterial production of natural and artificial products.

There are two goals in the project: 1) defining which of these enzymes are expressed as Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapts to a range of culture conditions and growth phases; 2) defining the roles of the component enzymes by constructing strains in which one or more of these enzymes have been deleted. Sodium/proton antiporter deletion strains will be used as backgrounds for studying the role of the NADH dehydrogenases and their deletions, by disconnecting the sodium and proton gradients. The role of the three NADH dehydrogenases and the antiporters, and how changes in their expression support adaptation, will be defined. The project will contribute to the basic understanding of how bacteria adapt to different environments.

The capacity for plasticity is a fundamental ability that most organisms use, as it allows for individuals to respond to environmental variation. While decades of experimental work have led to a well-developed understanding of many the mechanisms underlying plasticity during embryonic development and in the adult, the underlying genetic mechanisms are less well understood. Even more poorly understood is how these plastic response processes adapt genetically over multiple generations. This project will begin to fill this gap in our knowledge by leveraging the advantages of the buckeye butterfly experimental system: natural, heritable geographic variation in plasticity coupled with a laboratory manipulation. The goals of this project are to define how gene expression changes for traits that are fixed (not plastic) versus seasonally plastic traits, and to identify genes responsible for natural variation of plasticity in different populations. This study would represent one of the first efforts to combine all these mechanisms to produce an integrated portrait of seasonal plasticity. This funding will also contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students and help develop resources in insect genomics.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to study the genetic basis of reaction norm variation in the buckeye butterfly Junonia coenia. Geographic variation in seasonal wing color plasticity, coupled with the ability to manipulate reaction norms via artificial selection, makes this butterfly a useful model to study the genetic basis of environmental response. Reed will integrate across physiological, developmental, and genetic mapping approaches to address long-standing questions regarding the genetic basis of plasticity including: (1) What is the physiological and transcriptional basis of regional variation in plasticity?

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Margaret R. Krause is ""Trait Stability and Broad Adaptation over Forty Years of Selection in a Global Wheat Breeding Program"". The host institutions for the fellowship are the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)/Kansas State University, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Matthew Reynolds and Jesse Poland. <br/><br/>Crop varieties that maintain consistent yields across a range of environmental stresses are of value to farmers, particularly those who are resource-poor with limited ability to recover from crop losses. Understanding the genetic basis of trait stability across a gradient of environmental conditions will enhance the development of broadly adapted, climate-resilient crop varieties. However, trait stability is expensive and laborious to measure due to the extensive multi-environment trials required to produce reliable estimates. Since 1979, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico has sent wheat breeding material to collaborators around the world for evaluation each year. These trials provide a rare opportunity to improve our understanding of 1) the genetic controls underlying trait stability in wheat and 2) how the wheat genome has evolved over forty years of selection for broad adaptation. Broader impacts include developing data analytics training modules for plant breeders from developing countries. Training objectives includes acquiring expertise in genomics and bioinformatics at Kansas State University, and in the analysis of weather datasets at CIMMYT's research center at Henan Agricultural University in China. <br/><br/>The project will integrate genomic information, weather data, and phenotypic trait records from forty years of CIMMYT's international trials to understand the genetic architecture of phenotypic stability and the effects of long-term artificial selection for broad adaptation on the wheat genome. The project will develop robust estimates of stability for yield and other traits from data records that were collected at more than 500 locations ranging from Norway to New Zealand and spanning more than 3,500 meters in elevation. The project will also generate whole genome re-sequencing of CIMMYT's founder lines and weather datasets linked to the international trial locations. Data and methodologies will be made publically available in peer reviewed journal articles, on CIMMYT's Research Data & Software Repository Network (https://data.cimmyt.org/), and through Dataverse, an open source public data repository (dataverse.org).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recombination is a major force behind species evolution and genetic variation, and is the basis of nearly all plant and animal breeding. These crucial events are not evenly distributed along chromosomes. In particular, in many plant species with large genomes, including most crops, recombination tends to take place near chromosome ends. In contrast, central portions of chromosomes largely lack recombination, causing a major obstacle to crop breeding. The goal of this project is to better understand how modifying DNA in the cell affects meiotic recombination in crops. Recent advances in understanding recombination suggest that the distribution of recombination events on chromosomes can be altered by reducing DNA methylation, a special, naturally occurring type of modification of DNA molecules. This project will elucidate how exactly DNA methylation affects recombination. It will also examine whether DNA methylation can be artificially controlled during reproduction to change recombination patterns, which will be very useful for plant breeding. Gaining the ability to increase recombination in low-recombination regions of chromosomes will allow breeders to create novel combinations of genes that are located in these regions, and help them produce superior crop varieties. This project is conducted in collaboration with Drs. Chris Franklin and Eugenio Sanchez-Moran at the University of Birmingham, UK, as part of the Breakthrough Technologies to Advance Crop Breeding and Functional Genomics (BTT) initiative.<br/><br/>Recombination is initiated by the formation of numerous programmed double-strand breaks in chromosomal DNA, a small proportion of which are processed to form crossovers. Thus, the genetic variation generated by a single round of meiotic recombination is limited. Furthermore, the distribution of crossovers in plants with large genomes, which include most crops, is highly biased towards chromosomes ends. Extensive interstitial and centromere-proximal chromosome regions rarely recombine. Yet, these large genome areas contain roughly one-fifth of the genes in maize and even larger gene fractions in some other crops, which presents a serious impediment to plant breeding. Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation is a critical factor controlling which double-strand breaks become the sites of crossovers, thus shaping crossover landscape. However, the exact relationship between recombination and DNA methylation is not understood. This project seeks to elucidate how DNA methylation affects recombination patterns at the mechanistic level and lay foundations for methods to control crossover landscapes in crops by altering DNA methylation. To elucidate the effect of DNA methylation on meiotic recombination, a protocol to transiently alter DNA methylation patterns in meiosis using DNA methylation inhibitors will be developed. Chemically demethylated plants and selected mutants defective in DNA methylation will be used to determine which steps and processes of meiosis are altered by DNA methylation. The study will be conducted in maize and Brassica rapa, to explore the behavior of both monocot and dicot genomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Eukaryotes, on the other hand, have these structures and include plant and animal cells. The origin of eukaryotes (eukaryogenesis) is a major evolutionary transition in the history of life. How can eukaryogenesis and the pathways that lead to and from the prokaryote/eukaryote transition be reconstructed when fossil records are lacking? This project aims to look for the imprints left by this process at the structural and molecular levels across the diversity of modern-day eukaryotes. Such ""structural fossils"" exist in a protein assembly that defines the prokaryotic cell: the nuclear pore complex (NPC). By dissecting the NPC architecture of a unicellular eukaryote, Trypanosoma brucei, and comparing it to the available structures from other divergent species, the project expects to unravel the molecular processes that governed the evolution of the nucleus. The results should represent a compelling, modern context for teaching and disseminating fundamental concepts in structure and function relationships, molecular evolution and engineering principles of biological systems. Collaboration with the Rockefeller Science Outreach Program will make educational material to discuss evolution available to students and teachers. In addition, this program also engages high school and undergraduate students to work at Rockefeller University. <br/><br/>The structures of two of the main T. brucei NPC building blocks, the outer ring complex and the mRNA export platform, will be solved by using an integrative approach that involves: (i) gathering a diverse set of experimental data, including electron microscopy, cross-linking and mass spectrometry and quantitative proteomics: (ii) translation of the resulting data into spatial restraints that are used to calculate the structure of the assembly; and finally, (iii) a detailed comparative analysis of the NPC core components and architecture, covering representative organisms across the eukaryotic lineage.

Wild lyrebirds learn to sing near-perfect renditions of the calls of other birds and many other natural sounds, while lyrebirds that live near people are exact mimics of car alarms, chainsaws, and even camera shutters. Yet lyrebirds do not learn only from their environment; they also learn sounds from other lyrebirds. This ability to first learn and then produce a great variety of sounds has many parallels to the ways that humans learn language and other components of our cultures, making lyrebirds an excellent species on which to conduct experiments about the basics of cultural learning and information exchange that would be impossible with human subjects. The Cornell University scientists leading this project will study lyrebirds across their range in Australia to document their learning ability and track the learned components of their songs. The scientists will conduct a series of experiments in which they 'seed' a new song into a group of lyrebirds and track how it is passed from one lyrebird to another, to better understand what kinds of factors are important in cultural learning. They will also take advantage of a historical experiment using a population of lyrebirds that was introduced into Tasmania in the 1930s, tracking how these lyrebirds retained their original songs while learning new ones. The team will generate a variety of public outreach materials using videos of lyrebird displays, and engage groups of US college students through a summer research program.<br/><br/>Cultural evolution shapes the behavioral repertoires of many non-human animals, but the associated interactions among culture, genetics and ecological context remain poorly understood. Socially transmitted, multicomponent communication systems are of particular value for testing questions about the tempos and modes of cultural evolution. This project leverages the spectacular display behavior of a well-known vocal mimic, the superb lyrebird, to test a series of hypotheses about the tempos and modes of cultural evolution, using complementary comparative approaches and field-based experiments. Like humans, lyrebirds are excellent vocal mimics. In addition, they communicate using multi-component signals made up of both mimetic and non-mimetic song, and perform a complex dance display. Combined with limited dispersal and a large but patchy distribution, these attributes foster the development of diverse lyrebird 'cultures'. This project will first characterize geographic variation in audiovisual repertoires and compare this with genomic variation and divergence from local to metapopulation scales, accounting for ecological context. A temporal analysis of changes in acoustic displays, using archived recordings (1932-present), will complement the spatial analysis and strengthen conclusions regarding the tempo and mode of lyrebird cultural evolution. The project further capitalizes on a serendipitous experiment in which lyrebirds were introduced to an island (Tasmania) where they did not occur previously. Comparisons of lyrebird displays in translocated versus source population will be used to test the cultural lability of different display components. Finally, mechanisms of social transmission, and the cultural lability of lyrebird displays, will be tested directly using innovative field-based cultural transmission experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. A key attribute of human language is vocal learning, or the ability to learn to produce new sounds, which is only found in a limited number of other species. Understanding the few cases in which vocal learning has evolved could therefore shed light on the evolutionary origins of language. One possible function of vocal learning is that it allows animals to make their calls sound more like those of their social group members, which serves as a sign of group membership. Another possible function is to allow animals to learn unique sounds to address specific individuals, similar to the way in which humans use names. The Fellow will test both of these hypotheses in African elephants, in which vocal learning is known to occur but is poorly understood. Understanding why elephants have developed vocal learning could provide insight into the conditions that led to the evolution of this unusual but important ability in human ancestors. This project will also provide mentorship and outreach programs for students from underrepresented groups, and will contribute to the Fellow's professional development.<br/><br/>To test the hypothesis that elephants learn vocal signatures of group identity, the Fellow will determine if the calls of group members are more similar than the calls of members of different groups independent of relatedness. To determine if elephants recognize close and distant associates at the individual or group level, the Fellow will play back two overlapping calls from the same caller, which should only violate the subjects' expectations if they recognize the caller at the individual level. To test the hypothesis that elephants vocally label conspecifics, the Fellow will determine whether the acoustic structure of a contact call varies according to the intended recipient of the call, and whether individuals are more likely to respond to playbacks of a call that was originally directed towards them, independent of the identity of the caller. The Fellow will hone quantitative skills in acoustic analysis and statistics, and will gain career-enhancing experience in conservation biology through collaboration with other members of the sponsoring lab.

Interestingly, even when a stimulus is fixed, such as the odor from a food source, behavioral responses can be diverse, almost necessarily influenced by an assortment of factors ranging from the animal's internal state to memory. These collectively determine which one of many possible behaviors will be selected. In the odor example, the decision to approach the food source may be influenced by the degree of satiety vs. hunger, the valence of the odor (were these odors ""good"" the last time they were encountered?), any memory the animal might have about lurking predators (a calculation of risk versus reward), or an efficient strategy for search the animal has learned.  These are examples of the array of information that gets integrated to select ""the correct"" behavior for survival in a complex world.  Recent evidence suggests that control points for behavioral flexibility can happen as early as the level at which sensory information is first processed.  In this model, feedback or top-down projections from higher processing areas directly alter patterns of neuronal firing in primary sensory regions.  As a result, these feedback projections affect behavior by manipulating how stimuli are encoded in primary sensory regions.  Thus, animals respond differently because they encode the world differently. This project uses an array of experimental and computational tools to advance understanding of this top-down modulation of sensory information.  The project also includes the implementation of a computational neuroscience course for senior undergraduate and graduate students, and of a Virtual Reality program that enables students, including K-12 and local community college students, to visualize dynamics of neural networks.<br/><br/>This project investigates central modulation of peripheral sensory processing as a mechanism of influencing behavioral endpoints.  To study this question, two things are required: A feedback circuit in the brain that 1) encodes for complex representations including memory, fear, and anxiety for instance, and 2) targets primary sensory regions.  Recent studies have identified a direct feedback connection from the ventral CA1 (vCA1) region of the hippocampus (that encodes fear, internal state, social information, and learning) to the main olfactory bulb 1 synapse from where odors are first detected in the mouse. This connection provides a compact experimental system with which to interrogate how internal states and/or learning and memory influence the neuronal representations of sensory stimuli at the earliest stages. By using this circuit, this project: (1) examines the patterns of connectivity between vCA1, the olfactory bulb and other known target regions to identify the networks involved in this feedback control; and (2) determines how vCA1 feedback reshapes the activity of neurons in the main olfactory bulb in response to odors.  For the first aim, newly developed retrograde tracers are used to label connections from vCA1 to the bulb in tandem with automated whole brain reconstruction methods to identifying the structural logic of feedback circuits. For the second aim, optogenetic technology is used to control vCA1 activity while recording the activity of large populations of neurons in the main olfactory bulb, and thus to identify the physiological effects of feedback projections and the role feedback plays in encoding information about odor identity and concentration.  This project is co-funded by the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will support a network of institutional partners that are committed to providing internship and mentoring opportunities to youths interested in authentic research projects. The proposed work will build on a current research immersion program--the Secondary School Field Research Program (SSFRP) at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. SSFRP serves high school students, mainly from underrepresented and underserved communities, who work with college students, science teachers, and researchers around a specific science problem. Over the past decade, the program has had demonstrable impact, including attendance to college, and students' selection of STEM majors. Tracking data indicates that retention rates of its alumni in four-year colleges are well above the norm, and a significant fraction of early participants are now in graduate programs in science or engineering. The program has surpassed all expectations in its effectiveness at engaging underserved populations in science and promoting entry into college, recruitment into STEM majors, and retention through undergraduate and into graduate studies. Hence, the project's overall goal will be to extend and adapt the research-immersive summer internship model through an alliance with peer research institutions, school districts and networks, public land and resource management agencies, private funding agencies, informal educational institutions, and experts in pedagogical modeling, metrics, and evaluation. Focused on earth and environmental sciences, the summer and year-round mentoring model will allow high school students to work in research teams led by college students and teachers under the direction of research scientists. The mentoring model will be multilayered, with peer, near-peer, and researcher-student relationships interweaving throughout the learning process. <br/><br/>The project has formulated a set of testable explanatory hypotheses: (1) Beyond specific subject knowledge, success rests on increased student engagement in a community of practice, with near-peer mentors, teachers, and scientists in the context of scientific research; (2) The intensity of engagement also shifts the students' vision of their future to include higher education, and specifically to imagine and move toward a STEM career; and (3) Early engagement, before students attend college, is critical because high school is where students form patterns of engagement and capacities related to science learning. Thus, the immediate goal of the two-year plan will be to create approximately 11 research internship programs focused on earth and environmental sciences, and to build the networks for growth through engagement with a wider community of educational partners. The main focus of this approach will be removing barriers between high school students and STEM organizations, and adapting the current mentoring model at Columbia University to the specific cultures of other research groups and internship programs throughout the lower Hudson Valley. The team has already assembled a diverse set of partners committed to broadening participation in STEM using a collective impact approach to early engagement in project-based learning. Research partners will provide the mentors, research projects, and laboratory facilities. The educational network partners will provide access for students, particularly those from under-resourced communities to participate, as well as participation opportunities for interested teachers. Informal learning organizations will provide access to field and research sites, along with research dissemination opportunities. In Year 1, the project will conduct a series of development workshops for partners already in place and foster the formation of new partnership clusters according to shared interest, complementary resources and geographic proximity. The workshops will provide a forum for partners to learn about each other's visions, values, challenges, and existing structures, while working through theoretical and practical issues related to STEM engagement for young investigators. In Year 2, the project will target the implementation of the internship programs at various sites according to the agreed-upon goals, program model, research projects, recruitment and retention strategy, staff training, data collection, and evaluation plans. An external evaluator will address both the formative and summative evaluation of the effort directed toward examining the three project?s hypotheses concerning the educational impacts of scientific research on student engagement, extent of the immersion, and overall effectiveness of the programs."

Thus, interactions of genetic identity and learning build the behavioral and neural mechanisms of songbird mating communication. Like most mating systems, songbird mating occurs via male-male competition and female choice, meaning that males court many females and females choose the males that produce offspring for the next generation. Because female auditory processing and perception of male song determines which males produce offspring, females drive selection. The aim of this project is to determine species-specific mechanisms that generate female attraction to the acoustic features of male songs. Neural coding and perception of male songs will be compared in females of six species with highly divergent song acoustics and known genetic relatedness. Results will reveal mechanisms whereby social communication evolves. The techniques developed to assess perception and neural function will be shared with other laboratories and used to train young scientists at the postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school levels. The PI will use the approaches and findings of the project in her education work with high school students, outreach lectures and public interviews. <br/><br/>Comparative studies of mating communication, sensory processing and perception provide a powerful framework for understanding speciation and biodiversity. Songbird species with complex and divergent courtship signals (male songs) and known relatedness present an opportunity to test relationships between male signals and female sensory tuning while controlling for ancestral state. Females rely on perception of song acoustics to assess male quality and choose mates. Thus, perceptual sensitivity to song acoustics and the underlying sensory coding mechanisms are critical to female selection of the males that contribute offspring to the next generation. To examine how female auditory perception and male song acoustics co-evolve, female song preferences, perceptual sensitivities to spectro-temporal sound features, and central auditory coding of songs and synthetic sounds designed to measure spectro-temporal tuning will be quantified in six species. Measures of behavioral and neural auditory sensitivity will be compared to the acoustic features of conspecific and other species? songs. Songs of species in the family Estrildidae are highly divergent and relatedness across species in this family is known. Results will reveal behavioral and neural mechanisms for the matching of female sensory perception and male courtship signals to achieve conspecific communication and mate choice."

Exploring real scientific data helps students develop quantitative skills and understand the real-world context for core biological concepts. These methods provide high-impact learning experiences in undergraduate STEM education, which can increase retention and academic achievement for all students, including those from underrepresented and underserved groups.  A great deal of progress has been made in the collection, sharing, and discoverability of biological research data as a public resource. However, limitations in sharing and adapting these resources to formats for teaching remains a barrier to wide dissemination and adoption in the classroom. The development and publication of these resources represent the first step in the open educational resources (OER) life cycle, where instructors then find, implement, and enrich these resources based on the context of their classrooms. This network will identify causes and mechanisms to overcome the gap in the curriculum cycle after the development stage by designing a community framework for the large-scale sharing and adaptation of data-centric collections. There is an emerging need to address this gap given the rapid increase and availability of diverse research and monitoring datasets. Increasing the availability of data-centric resources will also promote critical thinking, communication, and quantitative skills, which are key skills for classroom success, for the STEM workforce, and for science literacy in an informed citizenry.<br/> <br/>The network will be composed of experts in information science and the OER model, experienced educational resource developers, leaders in faculty development, diversity, and inclusion efforts, and undergraduate instructors with interests in applying teaching approaches with data in the classroom. These diverse stakeholders will collaborate to build a working model for sustaining a technological and social community focused on emerging approaches and resources for biology data-centric teaching.  Through a workshop and a series of online meetings this network will (1) define the needs and challenges of different stakeholders associated with data-centric pedagogy, (2) explore social-technological solutions in order to create a vision of a virtual space that would promote the OER model, and to identify necessary incentives for sustained investment by faculty and module providers in the virtual space, and (3) conceptually synthesize discussions into a report which will serve as the framework for an expanding and evolving network. The goal of this network is to further elucidate barriers and generate mechanisms to overcome these barriers to wide-dissemination of high-impact data-centric teaching pedagogies in biology.  <br/> <br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

Such knowledge is critical to understanding how cells use protein-based molecular machines for many tasks, ranging from sensing changes in their microenvironment to controlling the speed of complex biochemical reactions inside of them.  These protein machines often utilize small molecule cofactors to perform and control their various functions.  Knowing how these cofactors bind their protein targets - and critically, where they do so on the protein - is essential for understanding how normal biological function is achieved, how this function is perturbed in disease, and how one might generate new regulatory molecules for biotechnology or medicine.  This project will investigate the development of a novel approach to address where and how cofactors bind to proteins by taking advantage of pressurized water to help quickly probe for cofactor-binding sites, coupled with NMR spectroscopy to yield atomic precision.  The successful completion of the planned research will yield new techniques which can be widely applied in academic and industrial laboratories, application results to a wide range of protein targets, and the training of students and researchers in a combination of cutting-edge biophysical and biochemical methods and analyses.<br/><br/>This project combines multiple solution NMR approaches with complementary experimental and computational studies to investigate how the unusual structure and dynamics of cavities within proteins form sites suitable for small molecule binding and regulation.  Such work is significant in providing quantitative descriptions of ligand-binding site properties, advancing the understanding of fundamental principles in biology and enabling the development of novel genetically-encoded sensors and ligand-activated proteins useful for the chemical and synthetic biology communities.  This research program focuses on studying cavities within a large family of ligand-controlled protein/protein interaction domains, many of which have small, hydrated defects within their cores which can potentially serve as regulatory small-molecule binding sites.  Several fundamental aspects of such binding remain cryptic at this time, most surrounding how ligand binding can occur despite these cavities being completely isolated from water.  As well, there is almost no understanding of how protein dynamics - well-known to impact ligand specificity and the transmission of allosteric changes in many other systems - are involved in such protein-ligand interactions.  To address these shortcomings, this project will utilize high pressure solution NMR spectroscopy in combination with other biophysical and biochemical approaches to: 1). Ascertain the prevalence of cavity prevalence and ligand binding within a subset of domains, 2). Determine how high pressure affects cavity structure and dynamics, allowing different conformations to be accessed with and without ligands and 3). Examine the functional linkage of ligand binding to control of effector domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The communication within cells that allows cellular processes to occur is mediated by interactions between proteins. Understanding the details of these interactions, including their strength and specificity, will allow researchers to predict and modify the many types of cell behavior. Results will provide deeper insights into how protein binding interactions function in different cellular contexts and help explain how a common interaction can specialize to perform many different cellular functions. Undergraduate students working on this project will have the opportunity to learn both computational and experimental biophysics skills, including how both computational and experimental data can contribute to a project to form a more complete model of protein interactions. Students will also work closely with scientists at Texas Tech University (Mike Latham) and the University of Liverpool (Elliott Stollar) and experience first-hand the importance of collaboration to the modern scientific process. To allow a larger number of students to have an experience with undergraduate research, a research-based lab course will expose students to techniques in computational biophysics and molecular dynamics simulations. In this course, students develop and carryout a research project contributing to the larger project goals. This project also includes the development of a one-credit course for science majors on women and underrepresented groups in science. This course will be geared toward all natural science majors, and will encourage students navigating a major where women are traditionally underrepresented to consider and grapple with ideas about identity in science. Topics will include the challenges that women and minorities may face regarding identifying as scientists, stereotype threat, and impostor syndrome. The course will prepare students to be leaders on the topic of underrepresented groups in science and include a service-learning project.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cellular signaling interactions often involve binding of intrinsically disordered protein regions to small domains, but the binding pathways for these interactions are often not well understood. Full understanding of how these disordered folding and binding interactions contribute to function requires knowing how the binding pathway can be tuned in different contexts by adjusting the disordered sequence, domain sequence, or solvent environment of the interaction. This project will address this question using an SH3 domain-peptide interaction (Abp1p SH3 domain binding to the ArkA peptide) as a model system and employing a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and NMR spectroscopy. SH3 domains are ubiquitous across eukaryotes, but the SH3 domain family contains many variations that impact function. These variations can influence the binding pathway, which in turn will affect biophysical properties such as binding affinity and association rates. This research will investigate how different aspects of the SH3-peptide interaction contribute to the binding pathway and biophysical properties of binding, ultimately defining a set of ""rules"" that help predict the ways that this interaction can be modulated with different functional consequences. Binding is hypothesized to begin with an initial encounter between ArkA and the SH3 domain, followed by fast initial binding of ArkA segment 1, and then slower, more specific binding of segment 2. Aim 1 of the research will confirm the role of the two ArkA segments in the binding pathway and determine how each affects affinity, specificity, and kinetics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of electrostatics in binding, and how it affects initial steering to the binding site as well its importance for specifically binding the correct peptide sequence. Aim 3 will focus on the importance of proline residues in the peptide sequence. Proline can uniquely affect conformation by switching between cis and trans conformational states and adopting a rigid poly-proline II helix structure. The project will help to advance our understanding of how disordered protein regions bind SH3 domains and how diversity between different SH3 domains and partners contributes to their functional differentiation. Understanding how these biophysical properties are tuned will not only impact the field of SH3 signaling, but also the wider field of disordered peptide binding, as similar mechanisms may exist for other recognition domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key molecular element of this synaptic connection is the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR), a protein in the postsynaptic neuronal membrane that conducts electrical signals to deliver messages from the presynaptic neuron. This process of neurotransmission is modulated by a variety of auxiliary proteins that bind to glutamate receptors. This project will illuminate how different auxiliary proteins interact with the glutamate receptor and with each other to initiate and modulate communication between neurons.  This study enhances our knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of brain function. The research will involve undergraduate and graduate students, providing an educational environment and training opportunities at the forefront of brain research. Outreach activities involving local high schools and colleges are planned as well to promote diverse participation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>It is increasingly recognized that the majority of proteins operate in cells within dynamically formed and re-formed complexes. This is especially important for signaling receptor proteins, such as ionotropic receptors in the brain that conduct electrical current through postsynaptic membranes to facilitate fast communication between neurons. The AMPA receptors (AMPAR) - a subtype of iGluRs - mediate the fastest excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. Correspondingly, regulation of AMPAR trafficking, localization and function is the key mechanism determining synaptic strength and plasticity that underlies high cognitive brain functions, such as learning and memory. It has been discovered recently that synaptic AMPARs function as complexes with a multitude of auxiliary proteins. This project aims to characterize molecular interactions of AMPARs with the cys-knot AMPAR modulating proteins (CKAMPs) and their interplay with the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). A large collection of AMPAR and CKAMP mutants will be employed to identify interaction domains and specific residues involved in receptor regulation. Computational structural modeling including docking and molecular dynamics simulations will be employed to guide further determination of the protein-protein interfaces, which will be tested by electrophysiology experiments, and to generate and analyze candidate constructs for successful structure determination by cryo-EM. This collaborative effort, combining complementary approaches and continuous exchange of information and reagents, may provide the synergy needed to reach a new level of understanding of AMPAR regulation. In addition to providing fundamental insights into AMPAR gating and regulation, the results of this study will also serve as a roadmap for investigating AMPAR-mediated processes in synaptic physiology.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and the Rules of Life Venture Fund.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are chains of small chemicals, called amino acids that are linked together. The number and order of the amino acids defines the shape or structure of the protein and also its function. Proteins fold up into compact shapes, but to do their jobs like digesting food or generating the force that makes birds and insects fly, they have to change their shape. This research is aimed at understanding how the sequence of amino acids defines the folding of proteins and how they change their shapes to function. Understanding how protein sequences control their shape and function will be of great use in designing new proteins for applications in biotechnology. For example, better, more active and more stable proteins can be designed for green chemistry bioreactors to make the chemicals used in daily life without harming the environment. Proteins are nano-machines and nanomaterials that will find numerous applications in electronics, computing, biosensing and nano-fabrication. All of these technological advances will be based on the understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, stability and function. The strong international collaboration on which this research is based will provide the students with a world-view of the scientific endeavor, and help them establish international networks that will aid them as they pursue their careers.

The underlying premise of the present proposal is that pressure, due to its unique mechanism of action, can provide exclusive insights into protein folding. Within the framework of the main objective, three specific questions will be addressed:  How does sequence code for protein folding cooperativity.   How are protein cooperative interactions linked to their volumetric thermal expansion.   How do residual native interactions in pressure unfolded states affect folding mechanisms. This project  will address central outstanding issues in protein folding and conformational dynamics, first by significantly and systematically increasing the experimental database of detailed protein folding energy landscapes. Secondly, it will provide experimental scenarios describing how sequence defines folding routes and cooperativity.

Although the shapes or structures of some of these complexes have been visualized, very little is known about their dynamics of assembly.  How do these differing components interact to create complexes whose function exceeds that of either alone? This is a challenging problem because of the intertwined motions of the components. Through this project, new tools will be applied to highlight the motions of just one macromolecular species during the assembly of a complex.  Although both proteins and RNA are present, only the RNA is visible.  Students will design, build and apply the new technology to study the self-assembly of a small plant virus, an intricate structure consisting of a protein shell surrounding a nucleic acid core. These studies will allow us to more clearly define the rules that govern the joining of nucleic acids and proteins into biological complexes. <br/><br/><br/>Many important biological assembles are comprised of distinct macromolecular components, such as proteins in conjunction with the nucleic acids. Despite their importance, less than 2% of the static structures in the protein data bank reflect RNA-protein complexes. Even less is known about the dynamic interactions between RNA and protein components. Although much effort has been expended in watching one type macromolecule self-assemble, e.g. protein folding,  it is much more difficult to interpret dynamic structural information for multicomponent machines because multiple species are present.  The inability to separate the signal from the distinct components precludes a simple interpretation.  This project will exploit and innovate existing experimental infrastructure to create tools that highlight the signal of only one species on the background of the other, vastly simplifying measurements of complexes' dynamics.  Mixers that rapidly combine the protein and RNA precursors will be constructed and will allow experimenters to track the changing structures of only the RNA component during complex assembly.  A small plant virus will serve as a model system for these studies. The development and application of two complementary techniques (small angle x-ray scattering and single molecule fluorescence) will offer a unique perspective on this self-assembly problem. Once established, these methods can be applied other RNA-protein complexes, gathering data to elucidate the rules governing their assembly.

Recent work in vertebrate animal models revealed the unexpected finding that a population of stem cells, called axial stem cells, fuels the process of body growth over long periods of time by contributing new cells to the differentiating spinal cord, skeletal muscle, and blood vessels, among others. Since axial stem cells have only recently been discovered, there is a severe paucity of information regarding their normal development in any species. The goal of this project is to establish the molecular mechanisms of axial stem cell induction, maintenance, and fate specification in the zebrafish.  This work will provide critical insight into how the vertebrate body is created, as well as shed light on the mechanisms leading to body plan diversity across the animal kingdom. Undergraduate students will participate in this project, providing them with a cutting edge research experience. Additionally, the project will also use zebrafish as a tool to teach biological principles to high school students, and to get them excited about developmental biology. This will be accomplished through two mechanisms: 1) the creation of a professional development course for high school teachers that will provide them with the training necessary to run zebrafish development teaching laboratories at their schools, and 2) a hands-on laboratory module for high school students. These programs are designed to meet the needs of the changing emphasis on laboratory-based hands on learning, with a particular emphasis on providing these educational opportunities to high-needs school districts.<br/><br/>Zebrafish offer an unparalleled system to investigate axial stem cell biology. The transparent embryos, along with genetic and cell transplantation tools, allow for the precise determination of the cell-autonomous, temporal role of pathways and genes functioning within axial stem cells in vivo. Using these methods, this project investigates three key aspects of axial stem cells, including 1) how axial stem cells are induced during the gastrula stage and maintained after gastrulation in the embryonic tailbud, 2) the mechanism by which the canonical Wnt signaling pathway induces mesoderm within axial stem cells, and 3) how the Sox2 transcription factor promotes neural induction in axial stem cells."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Laurel Yohe is ""evolution and development of chemosensory systems in tetrapods"". Most animals have only a single smell system for processing chemical signals that help them find food and mates, as well as avoid predators and noxious substances. This fellow is investigating the reasons why tetrapods developed a secondary olfactory sense system in their nose called the vomeronasal system. Explanations for why two smell systems evolved in the first place are incomplete and confounded by speculation. To complicate the story further, the vomeronasal system has been reduced or lost in many lineages independently. The fellow will apply innovative and non-destructive staining methods to museum specimens to quantify and characterize the variation in these two olfactory systems' function, from the developing nasal cavities of embryos to fully developed noses of species that possess these two systems, including those species that have lost the vomeronasal system. Understanding how these two systems evolved, and why the vomeronasal system is lost in some species, can help our understanding of chemosensory evolution and development specifically, but can also help us to understand sensory evolution in general. This study will prepare the fellow for a career as an independent research scientist, through the exposure and training of pioneering methods and new disciplines that will help shape the future research program of the fellow.<br/><br/>The majority of what is known about the molecular and developmental mechanisms of smell comes from model organisms. This project applies new staining and imaging methods to both adult and embryonic non-model organism museum specimens to test longstanding hypotheses on why selection on the vomeronasal system has relaxed in some tetrapods but remains well conserved in others. First, the fellow will use a non-destructive staining technology to a diversity of museum specimens to quantify the sizes and volumes of different olfactory structures in groups of organisms that are known to have differences in vomeronasal function. From this data, the fellow can test hypotheses for why some species have the vomeronasal system and some do not, such as having an aquatic lifestyle or being diurnal. Second, the fellow will perform a comparative embryology study of nasal cavity development in groups of organisms where variation in function exists, identifying key ontogenetic stages in which vestigialization may occur. Third, at the stages in which variation is thought to occur, the fellow will apply comparative transcriptomics to identify the molecular basis for this variation.

CRMs play critical roles with respect to normal variation between individuals, birth defects, chronic diseases, and evolution. Despite the clear importance for many areas of biology, these sequences are not well-documented. The REDfly (Regulatory Element Database for Fly) database helps fill this gap in CRM annotation by curating known CRMs and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for the important research organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). REDfly is the most detailed existing platform for regulatory element annotation for any animal. It's records include over 16,000 experimentally verified CRMs and 2000 TFBSs along with their DNA sequence, their associated genes, and the gene expression patterns they direct. REDfly is a well-used and valuable resource for the genomics, bioinformatics, and Drosophila communities and is an important platform for supporting hypothesis-driven empirical and computational research. It has contributed to numerous studies in multiple areas relating to non-Drosophila as well as Drosophila systems including CRM biology, CRM discovery, construction of regulatory network models, interpretation of genomic datasets, and CRM evolution. The current project will focus on continued curation and maintenance of the database so that it remains up to date and functions with maximum utility for its users. This will ensure that REDfly continues to be available as an important source of raw data for analysis, hypothesis generation, assessment and validation, and empirical research in molecular and developmental biology, genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, and evolution. The current project also has a valuable undergraduate education component. It will continue to be the focus of a University at Buffalo course ""Genome Annotation"", in which the students participate in annotating regulatory elements for entry into REDfly, thus making genuine contributions to the research community while learning the techniques of genome annotation and biocuration and the science of gene regulation. In a new effort, a REDfly unit will be introduced into a Developmental Biology course at Baruch College-CUNY, one of the nation's most diverse campuses. Students who excel in the class will be invited to Buffalo to participate in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program and serve as REDfly curators.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of this Sustaining Award are to keep REDfly up to date with the rapidly increasing numbers of CRMs and TFBSs being discovered and reported in the literature, and to maintain the REDfly site in a manner that will maximize its utility to the research community. The focus is on: (1) Curation. REDfly will be kept up - to - date as new studies are published. Emphasis will remain on in vivo assays, but in vitro studies will be included where encountered and appropriate. (2) Education. The PI will continue to use REDfly as the basis for his ""Genome Annotation"" course. A REDfly unit will be introduced in an undergraduate course at Baruch College-CUNY, and bring up to two course alumni to Buffalo each summer to work on REDfly curation as a part of the University at Buffalo Medical School's Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (SURE) program. (3) Service. REDfly will continue to serve its user community with a high degree of responsiveness, including rapid response to queries, custom searches and downloads on request, error correction, and support for undergraduate courses. (4) General maintenance. REDfly will be maintained in peak operating condition through identification and correction of programming bugs, regular updates to genome annotations imported from FlyBase and other sources, active maintenance of links to outside resources, software and/or hardware updates, etc. These activities will ensure that REDfly data continue to be available as an important resource for the scientific community.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. The proposed research seeks to better understand the symbiotic bacteria that live inside the cells of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a major role in the nutrient absorption for almost all plants on the globe. The pursuit of more productive, sustainably produced crops requires the manipulation of plants, from breeding practices to genetics to modifying the microbes associated with them. AMF provide dramatic benefits to plant growth, making them important organisms to understand for the benefit of agriculture. It was only recently discovered that almost all AMF have unusual bacteria living inside of their cells. These bacteria form a symbiotic relationship with the AMF,  but these bacteria are not well studied. This research will provide critical insight into the identity and function of these bacteria. The project will involve undergraduate researchers at Cornell University from programs that increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science. The fellow will also produce a course on fungal symbioses that will serve as a model for active team-based learning methods and shared online as an open educational resource.<br/><br/>To study the bacteria of a wide range of different AMF, the research relies on the extensive collections of the International Culture Collection of Arbuscular (Vesicular) Mycorrhizal Fungi (INVAM) at West Virginia University, the largest collection of living AMF strains in the world. The Fellow will receive training in the use and upkeep of such strains. Specifically, the study aims to: (1) use single-fungal-cell next-generation DNA sequencing to sample the diversity of bacteria present in members of all known lineages of AMF; (2) produce phylogenetic analyses of DNA from selected endosymbiotic bacteria and AMF and compare their ancestral relationships, in order to discover historical patterns of association; and (3) analyze genomes of selected endosymbiotic bacteria to find clues to their function. This research is potentially transformative because we do not yet understand these bacteria and how they might benefit or disadvantage the fungus-plant symbiosis.  This work will also benefit INVAM by providing additional information about its accessioned strains and by serving as a model study for the necessity of its collections. The Fellow will also develop necessary experience in genomics and continue their broader scientific narrative in the evolution of symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By focusing on the endangered Florida panther, which continues to be threatened by habitat loss and inbreeding, this research will further not only our efforts to conserve an iconic large carnivore, but more broadly, our understanding of how cross-species disease transmission occurs in an increasingly urbanizing world.

It leverages a novel combination of in vivo and in vitro sampling to achieve the power necessary to discover these effects, which would otherwise be impossible in a highly endangered species with a small population size. Using Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV; a common disease of domestic cats that has spilled into Florida panthers at least twice) as a test case, it will characterize effects of specific disease risk loci and inbreeding depression via genome-wide association (GWAS) and runs of homozygosity (ROH) analyses. The Fellow will then determine the molecular mechanisms underlying variation in disease risk using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and transcriptomic analyses.

This project uses mice to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms to represent and interpret vocal communication. Mice have simpler vocalizations, are more amenable to scientific inquiry, and have brain organization homologous to humans. Sensory processing of sounds begins at the ear where a representation of different sound frequencies arises and gets relayed to an area of the brain called the auditory cortex. This area is involved in some of the earliest complex operations needed to recognition vocal sound patterns, but the neural mechanisms remain mysterious. It is believed that one important strategy the brain utilizes to process vocalizations is to assign distinct computational tasks to the left and right auditory cortices, a division of labor called lateralization. Conceptually, this project will exploit this functional lateralization to dissect the neural mechanisms underlying vocalization processing. The instructions to brain functions and ultimately behavior are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying lateralized circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to sound processing functions is the foundation of this proposal. Using cutting-edge techniques for high-throughput circuit mapping, functional imaging, and optogenetics, this project will compare the development, connectivity and operations of the left and right auditory cortices. The results and framework of this proposal will be powerful tools to establish how the auditory cortex encodes the communicative significance of sounds. A unique aspect of the educational component of the project is to train students to develop of animations of various topics in Neuroscience to be distributed on various educational sites.<br/><br/>Vocalizations offer unique advantages for survival and social interactions by allowing animals to communicate rapidly over a range of distances, and encode an individual's identity. Accordingly, an animal's brain must perform the challenging tasks of recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. From humans to mice the auditory cortex performs many of these tasks, but the neural mechanisms are unknown. One strategy believed to be important in processing vocalizations is the division of computational tasks between the left and right auditory cortices (i.e. lateralization). The investigators will exploit lateralization to reveal functional differences between the auditory cortices that may underlie specializations responsible for extracting the valence and meaning of vocalizations. The firing pattern of individual neurons in response to sensory input defines its neural code and is determined by a neuron's precise pattern of synaptic connections. Hence, it is necessary to obtain the connectivity profile of cell types to link coding strategies with functional significance. Using the molecular toolbox available in the mouse the investigators will identify neuronal populations with lateralized activation using the activity marker c-fos, use circuit-mapping techniques in vitro to screen for lateralized circuit-motifs, and determine the contribution of sensory experience in the development of lateralized auditory processing. Circuit-level insights will guide experiments in vivo to establish their functional significance using a combination of electrophysiology and optogenetics. The results will reveal specializations underlying lateralized functions, and provide a short-list of testable neural mechanisms responsible for vocalization processing.  In addition to training graduate students and undergraduates, the PI will work with the Biology Animation Assistantship program at CCNY to create and make available animations on topics ranging from synaptic transmission to audition. A Student Assessment of Learning Gains survey will be given to assess the benefit of the assistantship."

However, for plants living under water-limited conditions, photosynthetic productivity can be reduced by hotter and drier climatic conditions. To counteract these conditions, some plants utilize forms of photosynthesis that increase the efficiency with which they use water. One such innovation seen in plants that grow in deserts or other water-limited habitats is referred to as CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism). The CAM innovation is found in a large number of diverse plant lineages and typically associated with stem (e.g. cacti) or leaf (e.g. agaves) succulence. The proposed research project will use several approaches to address fundamental questions about how plants use CAM and how genes involved in performing CAM are regulated in response to varying environmental conditions. To achieve this, the project will focus on the independent evolution of CAM in the orchid and agave plant families, both of which have species known for their ability to thrive in water-limited environments. This research will provide a foundation for understanding the genetic basis of CAM pathways and potentially transfer to economically important plants for improved water use efficiency under drought conditions leading to improved productivity. Additionally, this project would result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from under-represented groups. There are also plans to integrate the results of the project into classroom learning and broader outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project utilizes an integrated research program on two instances of CAM photosynthesis to illuminate the mechanisms that link ecological, genetic and molecular dimensions of the evolutionary processes that contribute to the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Photosynthesis is a fundamental process supporting biodiversity in the vast majority of ecological communities on our planet, while at the same time a physiological challenge for primary producers living under water-limited conditions. The evolutionary history of photosynthetic organisms has included repeated origins of carbon concentrating mechanisms that increase water-use efficiency and productivity in extreme environmental conditions. Crassulacean acid metabolism is one such innovation that has facilitated diversification of vascular plant lineages in an array of habitats. The proposed project will integrate ecological, physiological, phylogenetic, genetic and genomic approaches to address fundamental questions about how plants use CAM and how genes involved in performing CAM are regulated in response to different environmental conditions. The study systems for this project are the species-rich Agavoideae (Asparagaceae) and Oncidiinae (Orchidaceae) lineages, both of which include CAM, C3 (typical form of photosynthesis) and facultative or weak CAM species. These systems will aid in inferring the phylogenetic and environmental context for multiple gains and losses of CAM photosynthesis in both lineages. Comparative analyses of RNA will illuminate the interacting molecular and environmental drivers of shifts between C3 and CAM photosynthesis and the impact of these shifts on the origin and maintenance of species diversity. Furthermore, shifts in gene function associated with the gain and loss of CAM will be tested through genetic analyses of a yucca hybrid, resulting from a natural cross between a CAM and C3 parental species, and experimental manipulations of gene expression in the emerging orchid model species, Erycina pusilla (Oncidiinae)."

In rice, a specific signal-responsive molecular circuit has been identified that controls the formation of lateral roots that branch off of the main vertical root. This research project will investigate relationships between the sprouting of lateral roots and the rate of a specific molecular switch that regulates the timing of this circuit, thereby linking this molecular rate to the formation of the mature plant. These investigations will foster training of graduate and undergraduate students across multidisciplinary fields, and will be incorporated into a graduate level course on protein structure and function.  Importantly, a series of four learning modules that incorporate this scientific research will be produced and then disseminated via the vast network of 4-H chapters across New York state that reaches approximately 189,000 youth in regions that include low-income rural and American Indian populations. The primary potential societal impacts are to train young scientists in an exciting area of investigation, to contribute key insights into how molecular motions govern the development of whole organisms, and to stimulate interest in scientific exploration in youth who otherwise might not be exposed to concepts that span from molecules to plants. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to quantitatively investigate the role of a specific prolyl cis-trans molecular switch that acts as a timing device in an auxin-responsive transcription regulatory circuit that governs lateral root development in rice. The specific goals are to tune the molecular switching rate using gene editing, to measure induced changes in rate using NMR spectroscopy, to quantify the resulting changes in circuit dynamics in single cells using confocal fluorescence microscopy, and to observe corresponding changes in phenotype in the whole organism. The results of these experiments will be used to establish a quantitative mathematical model for prediction of the effects of this cis-trans switching rate on cellular dynamics, with impact on phenotype. The potentially transformative aspect of the project is that if successful, it will integrate knowledge across the scales from motions of individual bonds, to the dynamics of a molecular circuit that regulates gene transcription in a single cell, to a well-defined phenotype (i.e., ""genotype-to-phenotype""). <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics and Systems and Synthetic Biology Clusters in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Limited or mal-functioning social interactions can have a high impact on an animal or person's life quality, life span, and reproductive success - examples include Autism, Personality disorders, Williams syndrome, Prenatal alcohol syndrome and others. During social interactions, specific neuro-hormones change sensory perception and cognitive processes in our brains to be adaptive and optimized to these specific tasks. The investigators propose a detailed investigation of the effects of one such substance, oxytocin, on social recognition and memory using an interdisciplinary approach in mice that combines state of the art experimental and computational approaches. The investigators study to what extend oxytocin changes computations in the brain during social interactions, the neural mechanisms through which oxytocin causes these changes. For example, a lack of oxytocin can limit an animal's social recognition capacity and memory and interfere with social structures in individuals and groups. Understanding systems that play a role in social interactions and recognition has a potential high impact on understanding and treating disorders of social interactions. The project also offers interdisciplinary (computational and neuro-biology) and international (USA and Germany) research opportunities for trainees at the undergraduate and postdoctoral level.<br/><br/>Behavioral context and demands can modulate brain state and neural computations via influx of neuromodulators and -hormones. This proposal studies the relationships between brain state, neural computation, and plasticity by taking advantage of a well-established model system. The neurohormone oxytocin is triggered during specific behavioral situations and supports neural plasticity and learning in those situations. Other neuromodulators, such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline, and serotonin released in response to behavioral contexts such as attention, stress, or hunger change how brain networks compute to best respond to these behavioral situations. Although there is extensive knowledge of cellular and network effects of these substances, knowledge about contexts in which these are released remains vague, and correlating the effects of neuromodulators with specific behavioral situations is difficult. Olfactory system modulation by oxytocin provides with a unique opportunity to directly ask how neural processing is modulated to enable more stable memories, what about neural representations is important for stable memories, and how feedback interactions between sensory, modulatory, and cortical areas interact during the formation and expression of these memories. This project specifically addresses how and through which (a) network and (b) cellular and synaptic mechanisms oxytocin changes the signal-to-noise ratio of odor representations in the olfactory bulb.  The project also examines how the feedback loop between olfactory bulb and cortex enhances stable odor trajectories. To achieve these objectives, the investigators apply an interdisciplinary approach using state of the art experimental and computational techniques. A companion project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF)."

Most mammals do not form pair bonds, yet a few mammalian species including humans and prairie voles are capable of developing lifelong opposite sex bonds. Chemical signals within the brain?s reward structures are critical for pair bonding, underscoring the rewarding nature of partner interactions. Meadow voles are closely related to prairie voles but do not pair bond. It is unknown if the ability to form a pair bond is tied to how social interactions with a mate engage the reward circuit of each species. The Fellow will measure if there are species differences in how the brain?s reward circuitry responds to experiences with a mate. Moreover, the Fellow will experimentally manipulate reward pathways to determine if these circuits control vole pair bonding behaviors. This research will provide insights into how evolutionary changes in common brain circuits have resulted in species-specific social behaviors. This research will also inform our understanding of brain circuits that play a role in psychopathologies characterized by atypical social functioning. The Fellow will gain advanced technical training and will bring neuroscientific learning opportunities to underserved communities to increase their participation in biology.<br/><br/>Although prior work has revealed differences in mesolimbic dopamine receptor expression in prairie and meadow voles, differences in socially-elicited dopamine dynamics are unexplored but represent a potential evolutionary switch that may be crucial for the transition to monogamy.

Understanding diet choice is essential to solving a wide array of problems, from habitat conservation to medical compliance and nutrition. Taste plays an integral role in diet choice because it conveys nutritional and safety information about the composition of foods. Sweet foods motivate intake, whereas bitter foods are often avoided. To increase intake of bitter vegetables into children?s diets, repeated exposure is a common and powerful method. It is thought that learning about the foods may be sufficient to increase intake. However, previous research by the principal investigator suggests that there may be a shift in the taste of these foods, because repeated exposure can alter production of salivary proteins that change how foods taste. This project will test whether the suite of salivary proteins produced by rats differs based on the specific type of bitter chemicals consumed, how the chemicals and proteins interact with receptors in the mouth versus digestive tract, and how diet-driven changes in salivary proteins act to alter acceptance of nontoxic, bitter foods. This work will be conducted, in part, in the context of a new university research course designed to train underrepresented students in behavioral neuroscience research techniques and will be used as part of a sensory systems and nutrition outreach program in local elementary and high schools. <br/><br/>This research project will test the hypothesis that diet-induced upregulation of salivary proteins (SPs) allows an animal to increase consumption of a sampled, harmless, bitter food, but does not generalize to dangerous toxins. Aim 1 will examine whether the dietary acceptance driven by SPs is specific to the inducing stimulus, by comparing the pattern of SP expression in groups of rats exposed to different classes of bitter plant secondary compounds (PSCs). These animals will complete taste tests for each class of PSC to determine if increased acceptance is generalizable to other, sometimes similar, but more toxic, bitter compounds. Aim 2 will determine if SPs act by altering the negative signals from receptors in the digestive tract. To isolate the effects of SPs on post-oral feedback, licking responses to saccharin solutions will be measured while rats receive intragastric infusions of bitter stimuli dissolved in donor saliva with or without SPs. It is hypothesized that the presence of SPs will block the reduction in licking induced by bitter chemicals under control conditions, by reducing the aversive post-oral input. Aim 3 will test whether indirect exposure to bitter compounds (i.e., in amniotic fluid and milk) is sufficient to alter SP expression in offspring. SP expression of mothers and offspring will be quantified after maternal diet experience with PSCs to test for vertical transmission of diet preference. This research will extend knowledge of taste physiology by identifying a physiological mechanism for experience-based alterations in diet acceptance. The research findings will have broader applications to the fields of foraging ecology and human nutrition. The project integrates education and outreach activities with the research, and will train two graduate and 15-20 undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hundreds of olfactory receptors are deployed to detect a vast array of chemicals with exquisite sensitivity in complex environments. This collaborative project combines biochemistry, neurobiology, genomics, mathematics and new technologies to understand how the mammalian olfactory system detects, encodes and extracts meaning from chemical stimuli. The goals of this project are to: (1) elucidate fundamental neural mechanisms for how chemical sensation turns into the perception of a smell; (2) produce a vast array of scientific resources to olfactory scientists; (3) provide valuable  information for broader audiences, including for molecular evolution, chemical ecology, and flavor and fragrance communities; (4) establish new technologies and mathematical frameworks to study biological systems; and (5) facilitate applied chemical sensing technologies for environmental monitoring, food safety, and homeland security.

This includes how animals maintain function of all of their component systems (for example the nervous system, muscle and skeletal systems, and others) through development.  This also includes how animals respond to their environments throughout their lifetimes and across evolutionary time.  Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these responses is a major challenge in biology.  This information is not only needed for a basic understanding of biological systems, but also because our ability to predict the features that make animals resilient or inflexible to changing environments is poorly developed.  Predicting how animals will respond to environmental change is critical. Around the world this change is impacting many animal species, including those that humans depend on for dietary protein, crop pollination, and ecosystem services. The unprecedented pressures from expanding human populations, habitat destruction and fragmentation, ocean acidification, and environmental change are rapidly changing the environment in which animal species live and understanding and predicting how animals will respond is critical.  This project will bring together biologists, engineers, and mathematicians to answer these questions.  In addition, this project will provide opportunities for scientists, especially those typically underrepresented in these fields, to attend workshops and participate in research exchange programs.  <br/><br/>Animals are complex systems of interconnected elements (modules) operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Discovering systems-level attributes that make animals resilient or sensitive to change presents a grand challenge for biology.  Knowledge of these attributes and the underlying mechanisms controlling them are necessary for predicting how animals will respond to short- and long-term changes in internal and external environments.  However, traditional approaches in biology are inadequate for the task.  Significant advances can be made by incorporating tools from other disciplines, particularly applied mathematics, engineering, and modelling, but, mechanisms are needed for cross-training and facilitating collaborations at all professional levels among these diverse fields.  The creation of the Organismal Systems-type Modeling (OSyM) Network will: 1) Provide mechanisms to build and broaden the community of organismal biologists, mathematicians, modellers, computer scientists, and engineers using integrative, systems-level approaches to investigate stability and change in organismal animal systems and 2) Facilitate development of effective collaborations and the exchange of approaches, skills, and ideas among this community.  OSyM will advance discovery and understanding while promoting training and learning through research exchanges and workshops for researchers at all levels, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. Developing a quantitative understanding of the complex functions and interactions of many aspects of organismal biology requires development of new mathematical and engineering tools. By having engineers, mathematicians, modellers, and biologists working together to solve complex problems, advances will be made in each of these fields, likely leading to development of new bio-inspired devices, materials, and applications.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics and the Integrative Ecological Physiology Programs within the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research investigates how males and females display outwardly similar behaviors when the underlying mechanisms for these behaviors are predicted to be different. The project examines the hormonal and genomic basis of territorial aggression a behavior that is widespread across the animal kingdom and critical for reproductive success. Studies of male animals reveal that hormones like testosterone, as well as genes expressed in the brain, regulate aggression. However, aggression is also important for females of many species, especially in birds that compete for limited nesting space. An open question is whether male and female aggression are controlled by similar or different mechanisms. This research will survey multiple bird families to examine differences in aggression between males and females, as well as hormones, gene expression, and genome evolution. <br/><br/>The independent origin of similar phenotypes across distantly-related groups is compelling evidence for natural selection, but the proximate bases of behavioral convergence are poorly understood. This research evaluates the mechanistic convergence underlying a repeatedly evolved behavior: cavity-nesting. Both male and female cavity-nesters compete for nest sites, providing an opportunity to assess the nature and degree of mechanistic parallelism between males and females. This work will broadly sample genomes across a phylogeny to quantify positive selection associated with the evolution of cavity nesting. A comparison of hormonal and neural gene expression for multiple species pairs with and without cavity nesting will assess whether convergent selection on the cavity-nesting phenotype predicts male/female differences in aggression across families. This work tests an emergent hypothesis that gene sequence variation, neural gene expression, and hormone levels act independently to bring about convergent behavioral phenotypes. The project's broader impacts are designed to engage and retain students from underrepresented groups as they transition from high school to college. The fellow will pair with high school teachers near Indiana University to design learning modules on the reproductive stages of cavity-nesting, and engage students in hands-on research with interactive 'eBirdhouses' to collect environmental and behavioral data from wild birds. This project provides training for students in critical thinking, data analysis, and public speaking skills essential to success in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary goal of this project is to use theoretical and experimental approaches to understand the network properties of neurons that can produce the extremely precise activity necessary to enable these actions. Such networks are likely to be wired during the development of the brain, but the precise mechanisms involved remain a mystery. Previous computational models and experimental observations suggest that the wiring process is gradual. The investigators of this project will study how individual neurons are incorporated into the network. Of particular interest are postnatally born neurons, which have more immature properties compared with other neurons within the circuit, including a higher degree of spontaneous activity, which potentially facilitates their recruitment into the network. These ideas will be tested by experimentally tagging and manipulating immature neurons, as well as by constructing computational models and simulating the network growth process. The findings may shed light on how functional neuronal networks develop.  The research may also help to formulate strategies of repairing dysfunctional or injured brain networks through manipulation of neuron maturity. This research will involve a wide range of innovative experimental and computational techniques and provide opportunities for students to gain expertise in electrophysiology, neural data analysis, and modern methods of computational neuroscience. The principal investigators will train postdoctoral researchers as well as graduate students, undergraduates, and summer high school interns. <br/><br/>The model system used in this project is the motor control circuitry of the zebra finch, a songbird whose adult courtship song consists of a highly repeatable sequence of vocal elements (or motif) sung with millisecond precision. The timing of song is controlled by a premotor forebrain region called HVC (proper name). Each premotor HVC neuron fires once per motif with sub-millisecond timing jitter across renditions. As a population, these neurons drive downstream song production circuits to produce specific acoustic patterns. During development, precise timing within HVC gradually emerges while the bird is learning to perform his song. Previous experimental observations suggest that neurons are gradually incorporated into the network generating song-relevant neural sequences, potentially from the newly born neurons that are robustly added to HVC during this period. This project aims to investigate the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying the development of the sequence generating network in HVC. The central hypothesis of this work is that these spontaneously active, newly born neurons are preferentially added to the leading edge of the growing timing network. This hypothesis will be tested with a combined experimental and computational modeling approach: (1) directly imaging the dynamics of network integration of newly born neurons in vivo through a targeted retroviral method; (2) constructing a computational model of HVC that is constrained by these observations and using the model to investigate the mechanisms of the network growth; and (3) measuring the cellular and synaptic properties of newly born neurons and their spontaneous activity as they mature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This translation localized to axons and dendrites supports proper nervous system development and repair as well as basic brain functions including learning, memory. Importantly, the specific proteins that are synthesized locally in dendrites and axons is specified by mRNA sequences that specify trafficking to these distinct locations. Despite this key relationship of mRNA trafficking to brain function, many fundamental principles of how mRNA trafficking occurs and is regulated are unknown. Studies of mRNA trafficking within the cytoplasm pose unique challenges and require single cell, even single molecule analysis in real time in living cells. This project develops an accessible single molecule assay with a well-documented mRNA as a paradigm that can be applied to training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students. Using these assays the investigators will correlate changes in mRNA movement that occur after interference with cis-acting sequences or trans-acting factors that affect the trafficking of this mRNA in growing neurons. These results will uncover the basis for how mRNA traffics to sites of translation. <br/><br/>The integration of the research with the training of the next generation of scientists is important to the broader impact of this proposal.

One type, microglia, are star-shaped cells that survey the connections between neurons with their arm-like branches. It is important to understand these interactions because changes in neural connections underlie learning and memory formation. The Principal Investigator hypothesizes that microglia might regulate such changes in neural connectivity. This project will investigate whether microglia are directly involved in disconnecting neurons, and whether these actions are disrupted by injury. In response to injury, microglia lose their branches, and the Principal Investigator hypothesizes that this prevents them from properly regulating neural connections. The work will use a specially-designed microscope that images cells within the living brain. To make the cells visible, the microglia will be engineered to look green under the microscope, and, using a strategy developed in this project, each neuron will be labeled with a unique color. With this approach, it will be possible to visualize how microglia interact with neurons under normal conditions and after injury. Analyzing such images is complicated and requires neurobiologists who are trained to use high-level mathematics. This project will develop software and teaching tools to make the mathematics behind image analysis understandable to scientists who were not trained as engineers. The Principal Investigator will create an inquiry-based module about these ideas called ""Beyond the Image,"" which will introduce high school students to image analysis and digital processing. The module will be made available to teachers everywhere through websites such as the Cornell Cooperative Extension School's 4-H STEM site. <br/><br/>Because neural branches are small and densely packed, the proposed imaging of microglial modulation of neural connections is challenging. A technical innovation will be to infect neurons using a combination of virus strains that each generate a different color of fluorescent protein. Each neuron will be labeled with its own unique color code, enabling its branches to be distinguished. An advantage of using viruses is that both the type and location of labeled cells can be varied to optimize color-coding. Rather than wait for neurons to disconnect by chance, a laser will be used to precisely cut a branch off of a neuron. Time-lapse imaging will capture the reactions of microglia and neurons to the now useless, severed branch. The prediction is that microglia will reach out with processes to engulf and remove defunct connections. However, with injury, the microglia might erroneously allow aberrant connections to linger or might inappropriately damage normal connections."

In the face of climate change and other environmental challenges, society can no longer rely solely on past experience to understand and manage the living world. This award asks the question, ?What would it take to forecast ecological processes the same way we forecast the weather?? This project will development an operational ecological forecasting capability similar to weather forecasting that uses an iterative cycle between making forecasts, performing analyses, and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for building a forecast capacity, and also a crucial part of any decision making under high uncertainty. In addition to making ecology more relevant to management, near-term forecasts routinely compare specific, quantitative predictions to new data, which is one of the strongest tests of any scientific theory. This project will generate near-term forecasts that leverage ecological data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network and spanning a wide range of themes: leaf phenology, land carbon and energy fluxes, tick-borne disease incidence, small-mammal populations, aquatic productivity, and soil microbial diversity and function. This broad, comparative approach will be used to address cross-cutting questions about the nature of predictability in ecology and develop an overarching body of forecasting theory and methods.<br/><br/> The Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative (NEFI) will advance ecological knowledge at three levels: (1) overarching across-theme hypotheses about the predictability of ecological systems; (2) pressing within-theme questions about what drives process and predictability; and (3) advancing the tools and techniques that will enable an iterative approach to quantitative hypothesis testing. The overarching hypotheses of this project are that: (1) ecological predictability is more driven by processes error than initial condition error; (2) there are consistent patterns in the sources of uncertainty across themes; (3) across themes, spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated; and (4) spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated with limits of predictability. Overall, the answers to these questions address to what extent there are general patterns to ecological predictability, which would advance both our basic understanding of ecological processes and constrain the practical problem of making forecasts.<br/><br/>The expected outcomes of NEFI are to: (1) Disseminate data products and predictions that benefit society; (2) Develop new tools and cyberinfrastructure that enhances research and education; and (3) to promote teaching, training, and learning. Specific NEFI forecasts, such as tick-borne disease risk, aquatic blooms, carbon sequestration, and leaf phenology, are of direct relevance to society. Forecasts will be made available via open cyberinfrastructure that disseminates forecasts to the public and allows other ecologists to contribute new forecasts. To produce these forecasts, NEFI will develop an open-source statistical package, ecoforecastR, which will advance the tools and techniques beyond what is currently used by the community.

Instead, they harvest these venoms from their arthropod diet: ants and mites. More than 800 different chemicals were found in these frogs. However, the diversity of ants and mites is so vast that understanding how poison frogs gain toxins from their arthropod food remains a mystery. This project will examine the connection between frog predators and toxic arthropods, which are valued more by the toxins they contain than by their nutritional value. This project will examine the diversity, genetics and evolution of toxic arthropods and their poison frog predators. The relevance of this project resides on the discovery of new knowledge that can then be shared with the community to advance our understanding of megadiverse regions like the South American rain forest. This basic research will provide insights into how the recycling of toxins occurs in natural ecosystems. The research team (St. John?s University, European and Latin-American partners) will provide learning experiences to underrepresented groups in STEM with workshops for students and open lectures for the public in NYC and beyond.

Yet little is known about the functional, phylogenomic biodiversity and ecological processes that connect the toxic arthropod base with their poison frog consumers. The movement of such defenses in trophic chains requires an intricate ecosystem of connections among interacting species. To answer this question, this project examines a model system centered on a section of the trophic chain that includes poison frogs and their alkaloid-bearing arthropod diet. The project addresses two major evolutionary and ecological dimensions: (1) phylogenomic and alkaloid diversities across poison frogs and their dietary ants and mites and (2) transcriptomics, physiological adaptations and evolutionary parallelisms evidenced by differential gene expression among the origins of alkaloid sequestration in poison frogs and their toxic arthropod diet. These goals will address how parallelisms, coevolution/codiversification and convergence evolved in poison frogs and their toxic arthropod under the context of bioaccumulation, differential gene expression and gene diversification. Such comparisons will contribute to a new level of understanding of the cycling of defensive toxins across biodiverse Neotropical communities. The proposed research will use predator-prey dynamics involving chemical defenses in some of the most threatened ecosystems, the Chocoan and Amazonian tropical forests, where biodiversity is being lost daily.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project entails ""writing"" DNA in ways that change biological function. If the workings of genomes are known and understood, then they can be ""written"" from scratch. The development of the eye is controlled by special regions of DNA called enhancers, which turn on gene activity at the right time and place in the developing embryo. The project involves writing these enhancers in new ways, to test basic knowledge of how expression of the genes that control eye development are wired. As a test of eye development, the newly written DNA is transferred to the embryos of fish or mice to observe the effects on eye development. This project is a collaborative effort between a US laboratory with expertise in writing DNA and a British laboratory with expertise in analyzing eye function. The project has broader impacts through an exchange program of scientists who are learning more about DNA writing, a scientific meeting on DNA writing, a workshop on manipulating the genome of fish, and a tailored program to teach the genomics of eye disease specifically to the visually impaired. <br/><br/>The developmental and physiological regulation of human gene expression is controlled by enhancers often located at huge (100 to 1000kb) genomic distance from their target genes.  This represents a fundamental ""Rule of Life"" that is not very well understood.  What happens if enhancers are moved around?  Why are introns so huge?  What happens if regulatory landscapes are pared down to a minimal size?  What happens if the relative position, orientation, order, and spacing of enhancer sequences are jumbled?  Can they be put altogether into one big mega-enhancer?  These are all questions that currently do not have answers.  To help establish a platform for systematically answering such profound basic questions about how developmental systems are ""wired"" in the genome, a systematic synthetic genomics-based approach called ""synthetic hypervariation"" is employed. This approach allows variations to be constructed with high precision in yeast cells. The variants are precisely delivered to the native locus, preserving the genomic context that is likely critical for successfully interpreting the results. As a powerful model for studying the function of non-coding regulation and impact of its perturbation, these methods are applied to one of the most complicated mammalian genes known, namely the key gene required for eye development across multicellular eukaryotes, PAX6.   The PAX6 gene is a prime example of complex, long-range regulation in the mammalian genome. The PAX6 regulatory domain contains 31 known enhancers which orchestrate complex spatial and temporal PAX6 expression in the eye. Many of the enhancers were identified through mutations leading to the ""aniridia"" phenotype.  This project aims to obtain a more comprehensive and systems-level picture of how 31 (or perhaps more to be discovered) enhancers control this single key developmental regulator. The impact of the genomic changes are assayed using three distinct readouts: 1) zebrafish embryo PAX6-GFP expression; 2) mouse ESCs differentiated into optic cup; 3) Complementation of the mouse Sey (Pax6+/?) phenotype in vivo.<br/><br/><br/>This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In fact, modern societies are global networks of goods and services that are entirely dependent on freshwater.  Rapid global changes threaten many freshwater ecosystems across the globe, and the human networks that depend on them. Given the 100+ million lakes across the globe, very little is known about the role of lakes in regional-to-continental and even global-scale landscape function. The limited understanding comes from in-depth study of a handful of lakes, and it is assumed these represent the whole. What is needed is an expansion of studies to regions, continents, and ultimately the globe and to put that knowledge in the system contexts in which lakes sit - their atmospheric and surrounding land systems. Diverse perspectives, tools, and networks must be brought together to understand how global influences affect local water quality, the role of freshwater lakes in landscapes, and whether there are scaling rules (space and time) for generating regional- to continental- to cross-continental models for understanding how lake function. This need is far too vast to be the exclusive purview of any existing academic, research, federal, or private-sector network.  This project will build a global network of networks that includes scientists, as well as citizen scientists, to understand lake function over a variety of spatial and temporal scales and with different intensities of human-induced change.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to use lessons, data, and physical and human infrastructure developed within the Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network to build an inclusive global network of networks capable of synthesizing information about lakes in the context of their connections to and feedbacks from the atmospheric, terrestrial, and human landscapes in which they sit. The assembly of resources, including human, data, and technical, will work in concert with the global network as a Research Coordination Network in the service of diverse teams of scientists who can take on big macrosystem science questions with effectiveness and persistence. Specifically, the proposed work will (i) develop a network capacity for incorporating and studying the interactions of atmosphere-terrestrial-aquatic systems by expanding their resource availability, human expertise, and connection to existing research programs; (ii) build on an existing, successful, learning organization that can accommodate new disciplines and needs; and (iii) use the enhanced/expanded network to provide a new capacity for doing the science of - and scientific training essential for - macrosystems biology about lakes embedded in atmosphere-terrestrial-human landscapes. Cross cutting scientific themes include exploration of feedbacks among and drivers in atmospheric-terrestrial-lake ecosystems, controls on material flow, and scaling from ecosystems to macrosystems.  Early career scientists will be encouraged to lead expeditions, with later career scientists as co-leaders. Based on past experience, this model builds the team for team science, leads to a major expansion of collaborative networks for participants, especially for early career scientists, and results in innovative interdisciplinary products.

This remarkable diversity has served as a critical component of enhancing public engagement with science and nature, as evidenced by the multi-billion dollar output generated by bird-watching activities in the US economy. Birds exhibit complex behaviors, elaborate physical characteristics, and impressive adaptations, which has made them a major focus of modern scientific research. In current research, birds are a model system for comparative studies on a range of fundamental topics in biology. However, the missing piece of this otherwise powerful comparative biology toolkit is an accurate and complete description of the evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) among all bird species, i.e., an avian tree of life. This project will collect DNA data to fill this gap by producing a complete tree of life for all bird species in order to test hypotheses regarding the origins, diversification, and dispersal of birds around the planet. A complete tree will be transformative to fields like ornithology and evolutionary biology. This project will help prepare the next-generation of biodiversity scientists by training undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral scientists, and also will include numerous public outreach components including exhibits and videos. Developing learning modules and working with teachers will help bring the research into the classroom, reaching a diversity of students in several states.  Finally, the researchers will make all data collected from each bird immediately available to the scientific community and the public to enable broad-scale comparative analyses and integration with other avian data sets.<br/><br/>""Big trees"" - comprehensive species-level phylogenies - are revolutionizing the field of evolutionary biology.

A well-resolved, complete, time-calibrated, species-level phylogeny of birds will allow numerous challenging hypotheses to be tested, provide the conceptual foundation for a phylogenetic revision of bird taxonomy, and permit transformative analyses aimed at elucidating the processes that generate biological diversity. Specific hypotheses to be tested using phylogenies generated by this project include 1) Neoaves underwent a rapid radiation after the K-Pg mass extinction, 2) avian diversification has been shaped by the history of intercontinental dispersal, and 3) species tree methods outperform concatenation in phylogenetic analyses of genome-scale data."

N-Heterocyclic aromatic compounds (NHACs) are a class of small molecules that are pervasive environmental pollutants and pose potential health risks. Both Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus niacini are common soil bacteria that contain enzymes involved in breaking down nicotinic acid, a model NHAC, by different mechanisms. In this project, Professor Mark J. Snider at the College of Wooster and Professor Katherine A. Hicks at the State University of New York College at Cortland, along with their undergraduate research students, will collaborate to determine the biochemical mechanisms that these bacterial enzymes use to degrade nicotinic acid. Project-based laboratories will also be developed at their institutions to strengthen the biochemical curricula on environmental issues. In addition, this project will also educate and motivate the next generation of scientists through the community-based summer camp (BWISER) with middle school-aged girls. This week-long research experience will focus on learning modern chemical techniques for studying the degradation of NHACs and the importance of bacteria in bioremediation processes.  <br/><br/>This research will establish the molecular mechanisms underlying the enzyme-catalyzed degradation of nicotinic acid using a structure-function approach. Nicotinic acid is a model compound for understanding the metabolism of NHACs. Recently, the genome of B. niacini has been sequenced and a cluster of genes putatively identified to code for the catabolic enzymes that degrade nicotinic acid using a novel pathway have been discovered. This project will confirm the proposed functions of the genes by determining the effects of knocking out specific genes using CRISPR technology. Pathway intermediates will be identified and characterized by LC-MS/MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Using a combination of mechanistic studies and protein X-ray crystallography, the enzymes involved in activating the pyridine ring of nicotinic acid for degradation will also be characterized. These steps involve unique flavin-dependent monooxygenases that expand the reactions catalyzed by members of this superfamily. Work on the monooxygenases will concentrate on elucidating the structural determinants of substrate specificity and engineering these enzymes for activating a range of NHACs for degradation. Together this project has the potential to build on our understanding of the biochemical strategies bacteria have evolved to degrade NHACs. This work will also provide undergraduate students with training in modern biochemical techniques, skills necessary to answer complex questions about environmental contamination, and preparation for STEM field careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. All complex life relies on the function of multiple distinct sets of DNA contained in each cell. Mitochondria, the compartment of the cell responsible for energy production and multiple other functions, contain a separate genome encoding critically important genes. Differences between individuals in their mitochondrial DNA have consequences on organismal function, but little is known about how these changes contribute to the evolution of new traits. The fellow will leverage the power of a collection of diverse yeast species to build the largest dataset of mitochondrial genomes available for any single group of species and determine how variation in mitochondrial DNA contributes to two key innovations that differ among yeasts: the ability to grow at different temperature extremes and the ability to ferment sugars even in the presence of oxygen. The project will significantly advance our understanding of how mitochondrial genomes adapt and change with their environment. The fellow will develop an evolution education outreach initiative to provide learning resources to homeschooling communities in Wisconsin.<br/><br/>Mitochondrial DNA variation contributes to complex phenotypes in diverse organisms but mitochondrial evolution remains poorly understood. The fellow proposes to use genomic resources generated through the Y1000+ Project and the USDA strain collection to test hypotheses of mitochondrial genome evolution in over 1,000 diverse budding yeast species spanning 400 million years of evolution. The fellow will generate the largest collection of mitochondrial genomes currently available for any eukaryotic subphylum by creating and annotating de novo assemblies. Mitochondrial sequences will be used to test two hypotheses: 1) whether mitochondrial variation contributes to the expansion of yeast species into novel thermal environments, and 2) whether the evolution of aerobic fermentation has led to reduced purifying selection on mitochondrial genes. Mitochondrial genome variation will be associated with phenotypic data from laboratory testing of temperature preferences and metabolic traits for each species. The proposed research will provide significant training to the fellow through meetings with the Sponsor and Y1000+ Project collaborators, peer and near-peer mentoring activities with lab members, and writing funding applications with the Sponsor's guidance. The fellow will develop an outreach program to local homeschooling communities in Wisconsin that will serve as a framework for future outreach.

Algorithms have long been the language of computing, and all biological systems must compute (i.e., process information) to survive. Thus, the study of ""algorithms in nature"" can represent a new field of interdisciplinary research between computer science and biology. More specifically, this project seeks to uncover fundamental network design strategies and optimization principles shared by branching structures in nature, including plant shoot (above-ground) and root (below-ground) architectures, as well as neural branching arbors in the brain. Understanding the basic patterns that evolution has used to design these systems has bi-directional benefits; it can lead to improved understanding of how these natural networks process information and function in both health and disease, and it can lead to new computational strategies for building better engineered networks. Educationally, making the study of algorithms a requirement in life science curricula can help educate the next-generation of interdisciplinary scientists.<br/>    <br/> This project has three Aims. The first Aim is to discover principles governing how plant architectures grow and adapt to changing environments. This Aim will: (1) study how different network optimization trade-offs sculpt the shape of plant shoot architectures using the theory of Pareto optimality, and how different trade-off objectives are prioritized depending on the environment and species; (2) determine the molecular mechanisms (genes) that drive prioritizations; and (3) determine what search algorithms are used by plant shoots to find resources and to strategize growth. These questions will be studied using 3D laser scanning of crop species (tomato, tobacco, sorghum, corn, rice) grown across multiple conditions and time-points, and of model species with different genetic backgrounds. Overall, this Aim will link network design principles commonly studied in computer science with those driving network formation and adaptation in plants, and may help design and evaluate breeding strategies to enhance crop yield. The second Aim is to develop models of network warfare to study plant-plant competition. This Aim will: (1) create ""gladiator-style"" arenas to study how two plants battle for limited light; (2) develop game theory methods to assess whether dominant or stable strategies emerge; and (3) quantify how competition strategies differ based on the species of the two plants and their growth environment. This Aim will lead to predictive models of plant social interactions that can inform the design of polyculture farming spaces based on which plants ""get along"" the best. The third Aim is to test the generality of these principles to other biological and engineered branching structures. This Aim will test if the branching properties learned from plant shoot architectures also dictate the structure of plant root architectures below ground and neural (axonal and dendritic) architectures in the brain. For example, are root architectures also Pareto optimal? What search algorithms do they use to find nutrients? How does competition affect these strategies? This will also lead to the first quantitative comparison of branching structures across two kingdoms of life, from plants to neurons. Finally, this Aim will also study human-engineered networks that also must adapt their structure to resource availability and demand in dynamic environments. Insights from biology could reveal new strategies for optimal reconstruction of damaged infrastructure after war or natural disasters, or extension of existing infrastructure into developing areas.<br/>    <br/> URL: http://www.snl.salk.edu/~navlakha/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the outstandingly rich, relatively little-known fossil beds of Patagonia, southern Argentina, provide an unrivaled opportunity to learn whether life responded differently to mass extinction, plate tectonics, and past climate change on the other side of the world. This project will intensively sample and analyze fossil plants and animals from Patagonia through about 20 million years, from just before the end-Cretaceous dinosaur extinction (66 million years ago), through the early recovery period and the Eocene warming interval. Through groundbreaking field discoveries and state-of-the-art lab techniques, this research aims to transform understanding of the origins of the Southern Hemispheres flora and environments, the role of Patagonia, and the legacy of surviving living fossils now located in vulnerable rainforest areas as far away as Southeast Asia. The work will generate the most complete terrestrial record and curated fossil-plant collection for the Southern Hemisphere through a critical interval of Earth history. It will produce a new, globally significant reference point for studying mass extinction, recovery, and response to climate change from a fossilized living laboratory, with direct importance for conservation and ecosystem management today. In addition to scholarly publications and meeting presentations, a large number of educational, training, and outreach activities are planned. These will include exhibits, educational resource development for public engagement with the fossil sites, and a trilingual childrens book. <br/> <br/>The project will use field paleontology and stratigraphy at a series of exceptional Patagonian fossil localities, dating from the latest Cretaceous to middle Eocene, to elevate understanding of Patagonia's uniquely informative fossil floras. Most of the fossil sites are located in the La Colonia, Lefipan, Salamanca, Penas Coloradas, and Huitrera formations of Chubut and neighboring provinces. The research will focus on five, broadly related questions targeting significant gaps in knowledge. (1) Was Patagonia a refuge from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction? (2) What are the composition, diversity, and biogeographic affinities of the earliest Paleocene floras and insect faunas?

The key question to be addressed is, how are nuclear form and function influenced by mechanical properties?  Experiments will apply mechanical forces to individual animal and plant cells, and changes in the shape of the nuclei and the function of the enclosed DNA will be measured.  The results are expected to improve our ability to predict and manipulate how organisms respond and adapt to mechanical stresses encountered in the environment.

Studies in the well-established model organism, social amoeba Dictyostelium, have demonstrated that directed movement is orchestrated by a vast network of molecular pathways that are activated in response to the chemical or mechanical signals. Similar molecular pathways have also been observed in mammalian cells that utilize amoeboid-type movement, such as white blood cells and metastatic tumor cells. To better understand the molecular networks controlling cell to surface attachment in directed cell movement of amoeboid cells, this research will examine interactions between known regulators of cell attachment,identify new players in the process, and explore the role of mechanical forces and their transmission to the molecular network in directed movement in Dictyostelium cells. This research will provide training opportunities for many undergraduate students performing primary research either in the investigator's laboratory, or in a course-based setting, as well as high school students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. Students will gain hands-on experience in current techniques in molecular and cell biology and biochemistry, and will develop valuable critical thinking and scientific reasoning skills. To further promote higher education in STEM-related fields in the upcoming generation, this program also includes hosting visits of preschool and high school students to SUNY Oswego, where they can directly interact with and learn from the students conducting primary research.<br/><br/>Chemotaxis, or migration in a chemoattractant gradient, is the best understood mode of directed cell migration, and involves activation of multiple signal transduction pathways downstream of a chemoattractant receptor, leading to biased actin polymerization. In contrast to chemotaxis, detailed mechanisms of shear flow-induced migration are not known. Furthermore, the role of cell-substrate adhesion during directed cell migration in cells that utilize amoeboid-type migration is unclear. The hypothesis of this study is that in addition to its involvement in overall directed migration, cell-substrate adhesion plays a unique role in the initiation of and directional sensing during shear flow-induced migration. Using an established model system for amoeboid-type motility, Dictyostelium discoideum, this research will investigate the interplay between adhesion and directed cell migration in two ways. First, this study will test the genetic and molecular interaction between Rap1/Phg2, a known pathway that controls adhesion in Dictyostelium, and a new regulator of adhesion and chemotaxis, KrsB. A suppressor screen will also be conducted in a course-based setting to identify potentially novel KrsB partners. Second, this project will examine the effects of various perturbations in cell substrate adhesion and its coupling to the actin cytoskeleton on the initial response to shear flow. Taken together, this study will greatly expand the understanding of the signal transduction events involved in non-integrin based adhesion and its role in directed cell migration to various cues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The striatum, a major part of a key motor system in the brain called basal ganglia, is known to exert a fundamental role in controlling the execution of habitual actions. What is not known is exactly how the striatum coordinates the activity of its neurons to ensure proper execution of habitual actions. Recent findings suggest that a particular neurotransmitter transporter, the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAT3, might act as a key player in controlling the time course of excitatory transmission in multiple regions of the brain, including in the striatum. This research project will determine how EAAT3 controls glutamatergic signaling and synaptic integration onto two distinct types of striatal neurons. To accomplish this goal, the investigators use a comprehensive and multidisciplinary toolbox that includes electrophysiological, optical imaging, and computer modeling approaches, as well as mice genetically-engineered that express either D1- or D2-type dopamine neurons.. The project includes training of graduate and undergraduate students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines while advancing and transforming our knowledge of striatal circuits. Inclusion of underrepresented minorities and public engagement activities are an integral part of the project, to broaden its impact with the general public.<br/><br/>Our ability to perform movements relies on the activity of a neuronal circuit known as the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway. Relay of information in the CSTC pathway relies on the coordinated activation of neurons in the striatum, a major node of the CSTC pathway. The striatum is largely composed of two types of long-projection neurons that express either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. Glutamate transporters are abundantly expressed in the striatum but their role in controlling the coordinated activity of striatal neurons remains enigmatic. The first goal of this project is to determine how neuronal glutamate transporters regulate excitatory transmission in D1- and D2-expressing neurons. The second goal is to determine how these transporters shape the temporal accuracy with which these cells relay information from incoming excitatory inputs. The experimental strategies entail innovative multi-disciplinary approaches based on electrophysiology, optogenetics, imaging and computer modeling. The proposed research will generate new knowledge on the functional role of glutamate transporters in the activity patterns and dynamics of circuits implicated in habitual movement execution."

It will uncover basic principles of molecular evolution that explain how organisms adapt to environmental changes in the short term and how species adapt to environmental changes in the long term. The project focuses on a molecule called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD+, which is required to extract energy from nutrients. NAD+ levels in cells fluctuate with metabolic conditions, and these fluctuations are sensed by a widespread family of proteins called sirtuins. When NAD+ levels are insufficient, sirtuins allow particular genes to become active, which produces a response that allows the organism to adjust to the low NAD+. This project examines the hypothesis that new responses to low NAD+ stress can arise when new genes come under the control of sirtuins. In addition to advancing the understanding of molecular evolutionary processes, this project will enhance the scientific infrastructure by training the next generation of scientists in three ways. First, the experiments will be conducted by two PhD students. Through their work, the students will learn analytical, laboratory, and computational skills. Second, the project will provide summer research opportunities for four undergraduates. These undergraduates will be introduced to experimental science and discover whether a research career is a good fit. Third, the project will enhance undergraduate education in genetics at the University at Buffalo. The PI will develop interactive teaching modules for an undergraduate genetics course. These activities will increase student engagement and academic success by helping them appreciate the relevance of genetics to their lives and careers. <br/>     <br/>Although scientists have long studied how deacetylation by sirtuins modulates cellular processes, there has been little consideration of the evolutionary implications of changes in sirtuin targets. This project addresses the issue by investigating how the yeast sirtuin-containing complex SUM1C contributes to phenotypic variation and adaptive evolution. SUM1C is composed of a sirtuin deacetylase and a DNA-binding protein that targets the deacetylase to particular genomic locations. The central hypothesis is that SUM1C serves as a rewiring point that allows yeast species to evolve distinct responses to low NAD+ stress by bringing new genes under the control of an NAD+-dependent deacetylase. This project will identify SUM1C target genes in eight phylogenetically distributed yeast species using a combination of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. These data will be used to (i) investigate how SUM1C tunes transcriptional output to intracellular [NAD+] and (ii) determine the functional consequences of changes in the set of SUM1C targets. In so doing, this work will provide new insights into how sirtuin deacetylases, which are broadly conserved across the tree of life, contribute to phenotypic variation in the short term and adaptive evolution in the long-term.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The integration of these data, including fossil species, permits the reconstruction of the Tree of Life, which has been identified by Science magazine as one of the 125 top scientific challenges of the new millennium.  By documenting phenotypes for tree-building, researchers test major evolutionary hypotheses such as when did a species develop flowers? Or the ability to fly?  With tens of millions of species on the planet, organizing this informatino requires substantial creative computer infrastructure.  Such infrastructure has existed for genotypic information for some time, initiated in large part by the Human Genome Project in the 20th century.  Organizational tools and databases for phenotypes has not, however, received similar attention historically.  Thus in 2001, with support from the National Science Foundation, investigators initiated MorphoBank (http://www.morphobank.org/), an open-source Web application and database that has become a modern tool for collecting, organizing, storing and presenting data on phenotypes across the Tree of Life.  Because software must continuously change to function in the ever-evolving world of the Internet, this project is to sustain MorphoBank software and infrastructure such that the tool and database endures as a robust resource for the evolutionary biology community and the public.<br/><br/>MorphoBank gives scientists a unique digital workspace to collaborate - in real time - with others worldwide and to conduct data collection relevant to the Tree of Life and evolution.  Prior success of MorphoBank is underscored by key statistics. Each month scientists record >90,000 observations and load >2,000 newly-generated, curated and annotated images.  Over 2,000 visitors reach the site monthly to view projects >3,000 times, matrices >6,000 times, and media >75,000 times. 30% of published projects on MorphoBank are derived from separate NSF-funded geology, biology and anthropology grants.  Another >35% of projects hold the research output funded by scientific agencies internationally making MorphoBank a global destination as a tool and archive.  Scholarship that would have been impossible before MorphoBank includes the NSF-supported Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) project for mammals.  This research was published in Science and included  >12,000 images tied to hundreds of thousands of scientific observations by a team of over 20 researchers. The paper received wide press (New York Times, BBC, Time Magazine), including mention of MorphoBank as the research-enabling innovation. Morphobank represents a new element in the US scientific infrastructure, providing a model platform for location-independent global scientific collaboration.  Proposed contributions to education and training provided by the current project include: (1) a software course in Web-based bioinformatics for ethnic minority computer science majors from Stony Brook University, New York, (2) two summer internships for selected students from that course, and (3) two ""Morpholution"" courses at the American Museum of Natural History for high school students to learn scientific practices for studying phenotypes."

Despite more than a century of research on plant-virus interactions, control of viral infection remains a challenge to plant health. Unlike most bacterial and fungal plant pests, most viruses depend on insects who serve as ""vectors"" to transmit the virus to the plant cell, often through sucking mouthparts. Thus, a complex three-way relationship develops in which the host plant mounts an immune response that is countered by the virus and its insect vector. Understanding how and when this three-way interaction occurs is thus essential to identify control points of the viral disease. The goals of this research program are to investigate plant responses to infection and to uncover unique collections of genes and biochemical pathways that drive plant-virus-insect interactions in tomato. The results will provide candidate genes for engineering new strategies of virus management, and will establish the tomato-Potyvirus-aphid system as a model for studying three-way disease interactions. The research also provides novel insight into how the natural variation of viral disease is mediated within and across domesticated and wild tomato. High school and undergraduate students will participate directly in research to learn about the genomic-level science underlying viral disease in plants. The project will also encourage cross-disciplinary communication in plant genomics by hosting a summer discussion group at the University of California-Davis focused on plant genomics research.<br/><br/><br/>Nearly every major cropping system faces threats from plant-infecting viruses, and most plant viruses rely on insect vectors for transmission. Although numerous studies have shown that viruses can manipulate plant metabolism to promote viral acquisition and transmission by vectors, few have examined the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating plant-virus-vector interactions and none have developed a system-level understanding of this process. This work builds on the recent discovery that plant viruses respond actively to the presence of insect vectors via host plant-derived signals, promoting insect performance and transmission through changes in plant chemistry.  The aim of this project is to develop a detailed understanding of the genes and pathways that underlie viral ""recognition"" of insect vectors and activation of processes within the host plant that facilitate transmission by insect vectors. Transcript profiling, metabolomics, and bioinformatics will be used to develop a co-expression network and identify key regulators of this phenomenon. Introgression-mapping lines in combination with knockouts will be used to functionally characterize key regulators mediating plant-virus-vector interactions within and across plant species.

The light-sensing antenna of photoreceptor cells is an essential feature of the cells and must be continuously refreshed (or regenerated) in order to optimally capture light. Without this antenna, photoreceptor cells cannot sense light, and the photoreceptor cells die, resulting in blindness.  This continuous regeneration occurs by the addition of newly produced proteins and membranes at its base and by the shedding of the oldest proteins and membranes from its tip. Remarkably, the photoreceptor cell is capable of keeping its antenna at a constant length, as the dynamic processes of growth and shedding occur. The goal of this project is to discover the rules used by photoreceptor cells in the eye to determine the length of their antenna. In addition to understanding this vital regeneration process, this proposal will allow a new generation of STEM scholars to learn the skills that are vital to thrive in STEM disciplines. In particular, a cohort of students, undergraduates and graduate students, will participate in the research and gain vital training and mentoring in mathematical/computer modeling and life science. This project also incorporates activities to increase current and future participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education and careers.<br/><br/>This project seeks to discover the rules used by photoreceptor cells to calculate and balance rates of growth and shedding of proteins and membranes in their light-sensing antenna to maintain a constant length of their cellular antennas. Rules will be discovered using genetically manipulated zebrafish that reveal the dynamic regenerative process in the photoreceptor's antenna. One set of experiments is designed to stimulate extra growth at the base, and results will reveal whether antenna length increases or whether shedding increases to balance the extra growth rate to maintain a length constant. Another set of experiments is designed in which shedding from the tip will be blocked, and results will reveal whether antenna length will increase due to blocked shedding or whether growth at the base slows to balance the extra length at the tip to maintain a length constant. Finally, mathematical models will be developed to predict the length of photoreceptor antenna following experimental manipulation. Such models are based on our current understanding of growth and shedding, where model output will be fit/compared to experimental data of antenna length. The beauty of such a model is that it can be used to help reveal (and even predict, alongside with future experiments) the regulatory mechanisms that photoreceptors use to maintain the constant length of their sensory antennas. The outcomes of this proposal will serve as an important foundation for future efforts to define the cellular machinery in photoreceptors that contribute to the critical regenerative process of their light-sensing antenna.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Outcomes from this work will facilitate investigating the exceptional ways hornworts fix nitrogen through symbiosis with cyanobacteria and fix carbon using a specialized carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM). Hornworts are also critical for understanding major transitions in plant evolution because they represent a critical step in the formation of land plants and have a set of unique developmental features. The genetic transformation and gene-editing tools developed in this study will be disseminated broadly and rapidly to the scientific community. A symposium and a workshop will be held to build a thriving hornwort community and provide hands-on experiences on hornwort research tools. In addition, through the Boyce Thompson Institute Summer Internship program, three undergraduate students will be mentored. The interns will be able to take advantage of the integrative nature of this project, and learn plant tissue culture, wet lab experiments, and bioinformatics. Finally, by enabling genetic research to investigate hornworts? unique cyanobacteria symbiosis and CCM, this project could have agricultural implications to improve nitrogen and carbon assimilation in crop plants. <br/><br/>Despite having the potential to address a diversity of long-standing questions in biology, research on hornworts has been limited by a lack of genetic tools. Past research using RNA-sequencing and comparative genomics has identified several candidate genes involved in cyanobacteria symbiosis and CCM, but further investigation of these candidates is limited by the lack of a reverse genetic toolkit. Gene transfer or transformation in hornworts has been demonstrated, but the efficiency is very low and results are inconsistent. The goal of this project is to establish robust transformation and gene editing methodologies in the hornwort Anthoceros agrestis. Enabling genetic research in hornworts will not only complement the other two bryophyte models (the moss Physcomitrella patens and the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha) but will also provide unprecedented opportunities to study a unique plant with unparalleled biological properties. A wide range of scientific communities will benefit, including researchers working on plant evolution, developmental genetics, paleobiology, photobiology, plant-microbe interaction, and photosynthesis.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Enabling Discovery through GEnomic tools (EDGE) Program and the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) in the Division of Integrated Organismal Systems<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way that visual systems accomplish this task is through selective attention, where an animal attends to a portion of the available visual stimuli at a time. Tiny jumping spiders have microminiature eyes that are nearly as acute as a human's and, like humans, pays attention and discriminates among visual targets. This project investigates how jumping spiders pay attention to and identify moving visual objects.  The simplicity of the jumping spider eye and brain makes it easier to learn how the brain's neural networks ""compute"" visual movement and object identification, than in humans.  In humans AND jumping spiders, selective visual attention is measured by rapid movements of their eyes to focus on targets of interest. This study employs an innovative eyetracker to measure the direction of a spider's gaze as it views video images. In addition, neural techniques are used to measure the activity of the spider's brain while its gaze is being monitored: specific parts of the brain respond differentially to particular images and sounds. Thus, it is possible to see both what engages a spider's visual attention as well as how different stimuli are interpreted. Understanding this elegant, miniaturized and extremely effective visual system will be of interest to roboticists and engineers, for whom micro-miniaturization of biosensors is a premium in small, self-autonomous robots. In addition, the PI will train a graduate student, a postdoc, and undergraduates, and will create videos for a project called ""Faces and Voices of Science"" that highlight the personal stories of researchers from different backgrounds. The videos will be made available online for teachers and professors to incorporate in lectures.<br/><br/><br/>Visual animals face the problem of distinguishing relevant from distracting stimuli quickly and efficiently.  One way to do this is through selective attention, where the animal attends to only part of the visual field at a time, through a process of saccadic eye movements and selective target scan.  This is true for humans and at the behavioral level seems true for jumping spiders.  These spiders are highly visual and are among the rare invertebrate animals that have moveable eyes.  The PIs have developed two novel technologies that allow a comprehensive study of selective visual attention.  These include an innovative spider eyetracker can monitor with precision a spider's eye movements in real time as they scan a stimulus image and the first electrophysiological recordings in the brain of a living spider as it observes visual stimuli. The eyetracker will be deployed to monitor eye movements while simultaneously recordings from single units in the brain are recorded.  The PIs will thus test explicit hypotheses about visual attention, eye movements, and correlated brain activity.  These include ""bottom-up"" stimulus-driven attentional processes by testing how different visual stimuli influence eye movements and neural processes in the brain, as well as ""top-down"" processes by presenting cross-modal cues and measuring eye movements and neural processes as the spider searches for relevant stimuli among distractors."

Current evidence shows that RNA function can be regulated by the presence of chemical groups (modifications) that are added to the RNA by specific enzymes. However, much remains to be learned about how the enzymes find their target RNAs, how the modifications change RNA functions, and how the modified RNAs regulate critical cellular processes. This research will address those questions, while providing a dynamic research environment to foster the scientific training and development of underrepresented groups in science such as minorities and women. To share new technical approaches developed during the research, students will produce video-based tutorials to serve as a teaching and training resource for the scientific community. The project will also provide educational workshops for underserved high school students to encourage curiosity and experimentation in the field of biology. <br/><br/>Mammalian genomes are predicted to encode a diverse number of transfer RNA methyltransferase (Trm) enzymes, but the cellular functions for the majority of Trm proteins remain unknown. The following project aims to elucidate the biological roles of the numerous uncharacterized mammalian Trm enzymes by: 1) establishing the protein interaction networks of human Trm enzymes, 2) identifying the cellular targets of Trm proteins, and 3) determining the cellular processes modulated by Trm proteins. The goals will be achieved through an integrated biochemical, molecular and genetic approach involving proteomic analysis of Trm complexes together with global transcription and translation profiling of human cells with altered Trm proteins. Through these discoveries, the work promises to lay a foundation of new understanding of how the RNA modifications catalyzed by diverse Trm enzymes translate into physiological outputs that help cells respond to various environmental conditions."
