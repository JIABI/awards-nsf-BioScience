Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the tools to be developed will be evaluated by neuroscientists on domain-specific hypothesis-driven applications. The outcome of the project will be made available at the following websites: http://webpages.uncc.edu/~szhang16/  and https://github.com/divelab/."

Microorganisms that live in extreme environments, called extremophiles, are remarkable examples of life's resilience, thriving in hot springs at boiling temperatures, in brine lakes saturated with salt, and in deserts once thought to be sterile. This research uses halophiles, extremophiles that live in high salt, as a test system to map complex gene circuits that enable survival. Circuit maps are compared across halophile species resistant to different levels of salt and stress to understand how extreme conditions rewire gene circuits, and how rewiring enables adaptation in the face of stress. The high salt extremophiles of interest are members of the domain of life Archaea. Because the molecules that make up gene circuits in archaea resemble those of other domains of life, this research has the potential to reveal general principles of gene circuit evolution across the tree of life. The education plan involves collaborating with students to build solutions for analysis and visualization of archaeal data. The PI and her group mentor undergraduates through the summer Duke Data+ program to create interactive web-accessible tools for data analysis and visualization. Teams of Duke students contribute directly to the research by developing these tools. The resultant graphical user interface (GUI) serve as an entry point for experimental biologists into computational biology in archaea, reducing the barrier for otherwise intimidating genome-scale analyses. Duke Masters in Data Science (MIDS) students and graduate students from the PI's lab co-mentor the Data+ team and provide support for these tools throughout the academic year. This vertically integrated mentorship structure provides critical training in research mentorship, team project management, and communication skills. The team-based learning approach encourages recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to understand how extreme environments select for regulatory network architecture and function. Transcription regulatory networks (TRNs) vary gene expression dynamically in response to stress. Such expression adapts physiology to improve fitness in the short term and leads to phenotypic diversity over evolutionary time scales. However, the selective forces causing such rewiring of gene circuits, and whether such rewiring is adaptive, remain unclear. In recent work on halophiles, hypersaline-adapted representatives of the archaeal domain of life, the PI discovered archaeal TRNs that regulate critical cellular decisions such as nutrient use and damage repair. Halophiles provide a unique model for investigating the evolution of TRNs given their experimental tractability in the lab and adaptability during continual exposure to multiple extreme conditions in the natural environment. Previous research compared the architecture and dynamic function of TRNs across related species of halophiles. More recent research has led to the hypothesis that extreme conditions select for more highly interconnected TRNs, enabling rapid physiological adjustment in response to variable environments. To test this hypothesis, the research: (a) uses an integrated experimental and computational systems biology approach pioneered in the PI's lab to map and compare small-scale TRNs across four species of halophiles; (b) jointly infers global TRNs across species using multi-task machine learning to ctract-Sompare genome-scale networks; and (c) forces TRN rewiring with in-lab evolution experiments. This approach combines genetics, genomics, quantitative phenotyping, and statistical modeling, yielding rapid and unprecedented insight into the dynamic function of archaeal regulatory networks and their impact on cell physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Natural scientists have built our understanding of the physical world. The scientific understanding they built has contributed to the development of technologies and practices that benefit human economies. For example, genetic sequencing of DNA enables deeper understanding of biological organisms; the consequences for human health, food production, understanding of evolutionary adaptation, etc. have been revolutionary and are still unfolding. The DNA sequence is the blueprint for an organism's anatomical structure (morphology) and function, but images capturing morphology are now much less prevalent than genetic data. Museums and researchers have been creating 3D digital images of natural history collections, and there are extensive 3D image data sets for some model organisms, but these data are mostly in closed collections, and generally unavailable or very difficult to access. This project aims to provide infrastructure to increase the accessibility of anatomical information, with a focus on 3D images. The resource will create the first open access, web-enabled image archive accepting and serving high-resolution, 3D scans of all organisms, called MorphoSource. Standardized descriptive tags will allow scientists to use this database to easily combine genetic and anatomical datasets for the first time, supporting the formulation of novel research questions. MorphoSource will link to other databases (such as iDigBio [www.idigbio.org]) that aggregate information on museum specimens from around the world. Having a shared common resource will change the culture among researchers and museums, making collaborations between physically distant experts more feasible, but it will also open the linked research collections of museums to anyone with Internet access anywhere in the world.  Large data sets are prerequisites for many statistical and machine learning methods, so the resource will enable innovations in computational image analysis methods, fostering new types of collaborations that advance field-wide scientific understanding. The resource will track data use, enhancing reproducibility and also providing an objective metric of the value of individual data elements. Open access to the data linked through MorphoSource will enable anyone with Internet access to see the detailed anatomical evidence for theories like evolution.  Pilot work has shown that teachers and students eagerly consume this newly available information, with numbers already in the thousands.  Positive results of this access include (1) providing a more intuitive type of raw data (compared to DNA sequence) for showing the public why some conclusions about evolutionary relationships were reached, (2) providing an 'interest metric' for the value of natural history museums and the collections they hold, (3) increasing the community of people (including citizen scientists) who have access to the data required to make important discoveries by studying biological variation. <br/><br/>The specific plan for creating the repository for 3D data on all organisms is as follows. The primary goal is to restructure and improve a proof of concept database called MorphoSource. The restructuring will allow MorphoSource to meet the needs of a growing community of researchers and educators through massive upscaling, and to implement a novel approach for economically preserving data for the long term. To accomplish this, the MorphoSource server will be rebuilt to use the Fedora digital asset management architecture, which has been developed by library scientists to serve emerging needs related to the archiving and sharing of digital data. As part of this architecture upgrade, the data hosted on MorphoSource will be given an additional layer of protection through managing asynchronous copies in DuraCloud, a digital data preservation platform that leverages Amazon cloud. This restructuring will allow the MorphoSource server architecture to be integrated with the Duke University Libraries repository infrastructure. MorphoSource will also be able to invite institutional communities to be consortium partners in support of data storage and to enact data preservation techniques that guarantee integrity and readability for the foreseeable future. Additional tools will (1) allow for rapid, automated ingestion of dozens to hundreds of datasets at once, (2) link MorphoSource with major biodiversity archives, and (3) provide in-browser visualization of 3D series of image slices, such as those generated by CT and MRI scanners.  The plan includes ingesting thousands of high quality legacy CT datasets from published studies, enabling their reuse, increasing the repeatability of studies. The project leaders plan to directly work with and design tools for K-12 educators and students to help them benefit from this resource. These datasets and educational tools will be available to researchers and the public through the updated MorphoSource website, available at www.morphosource.org."

Errors in this process result in developmental defects and disease in humans. In order to understand how an animal?s developmental program is encoded by its DNA, it is useful introduce changes in the DNA and analyze the effects on development. At present, however, it is only possible to generate and analyze a few genetic changes at a time in multicellular animals. To overcome this limitation, researchers at North Carolina State University (NCSU) will rapidly probe how cells adopt their fates by quick evolution of small DNA segments that help control gene expression in fly embryos, a good model for other animals. In parallel, the researchers will develop a device for high-throughput analysis of fly embryo development. This project will be undertaken by graduate students at NCSU as part of their research training, and the outcomes will be communicated through workshops and journal articles.<br/><br/>The rapid evolution of small, targeted stretches of DNA will be achieved through repeated rounds of transcription, reverse transcription, and reintegration in live Drosophila cells and embryos. The error-prone process of reverse transcription will introduce mutations into a DNA sequence that is designed to drive the expression of a GFP-tagged reporter gene. To screen a large number of Drosophila embryos for mutations that affect gene expression, a high-throughput platform consisting of a microfluidic array and automated imaging protocols will be constructed. Live embryos will be imaged, and machine learning algorithms will detect and sort embryos that have altered gene expression patterns. The sorted embryos will be harvested for further study. Beyond this study, the development of the high-throughput platform will enable screening protocols in Drosophila embryos, and also in other animal species. This technology can open new avenues in biological design and engineering.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences - Genetic Mechanisms and Systems and Synthetic Biology Clusters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will achieve the same for applications that use videos to track movement of animals, cells, or robots, by producing freely available software for efficient and automatic extraction of movement data and directly adding such data to a public database (the KNB Data Repository). The software will be easy to use and adapt to new types of videos, issues that have so far been roadblocks to widespread adoption of existing video tracking tools. The ability to share both movement data and videos will stimulate collaboration among researchers. Both functionalities will enable fundamentally new advances in such areas as animal group behavior, behavioral genetics, cell biology, and collective robotics, and other fields that record the movements of many individuals. The software, because of its ease of use and enabled access to research videos from the database, will also serve as a tool in teaching at the K-12 and college level. In addition, this project will serve to train several college and graduate students in both biology and computer science; such interdisciplinary training is essential for advances in biological research today.<br/><br/>This project will implement a unique combination of clear, current graphical user interface design to improve usability with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to improve movement tracking accuracy. In addition, the developed software will enable users to visualize results for validation and analysis, and include functionality for users to correct any remaining tracking errors. This will enable users to get scientific-quality data output without having to employ multiple software applications and without having to manually post-process data files. In the context of the project, several workshops will be held and a website developed to improve accessibility for students and researchers in biology. The project will also develop a direct link to the existing KNB scientific data repository, such that users can access the repository, compare their results, or complete meta-analyses easily. Besides advancing biological research, this will also generate an extensive resource for computer vision scientists by providing a large collection of videos with accurate user annotation for improving core algorithms such as object detection and tracking.

How the brain accomplishes this feat is largely unknown.  This project will identify how the brain encodes the vocal elements and sequences used in learned vocal communication. To accomplish this goal, state of the art high-resolution optical imaging and electrical recording methods will be used to measure neural activity in animals as they engage in vocal learning and communication.  This project will determine how populations of interconnected neurons that are necessary to vocal communication encode vocal elements and sequences.   Accomplishing this goal is essential to understanding the neural basis of communication and also has other important potential benefits, including the ability to diagnose and ultimately repair brain pathologies that impair perception or movement, and to design machines that emulate these processes.  This project will advance our understanding of neural mechanisms that enable the production and perception of complex, sequential behaviors, train professional scientists at the doctoral and postdoctoral levels, and enrich the science curriculum of high school students both locally and nationally.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is that it will shed light into fundamental cellular processes by which the brain encodes complex learned behaviors. This project's goal is to understand how the brain encodes syllables and syllable sequences in birdsong, a complex learned vocal behavior.  The study will focus on how syllables are represented by spatiotemporal patterns of activity in populations of sensorimotor neurons important to vocal communication.  Resolving this problem is an essential step to understand the neural basis of vocal communication. This project blends leading edge methods, including multiphoton calcium imaging of neuronal population activity and intracellular recordings and genetic manipulations in singing birds, to explore the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms that encode learned vocalizations.  Until now, it has been impractical to interrogate how the brain encodes sensory and motor representations of such complex behaviors with cellular and synaptic resolution."

Cells contain diverse organelles that play specific roles and interact with other functional units. By developing hybrids of living cells with synthetic parts (cyborgs), this project provides an innovative approach to understand modularity. Immediate goals are to develop artificial cytoskeletons to allow control of cell shape and organization upon command, offering insights into basic cellular processes. This project also examines societal impacts to inform the team's researchers and to help prepare public presentations to increase broader impacts. This work should spark public discussion on the role of hybrid organisms in society and will examine public concerns of producing something 'unnatural.' Additional impacts include training a highly interdisciplinary research team, with intensive mentoring in each group and across groups. The topic will engage the public and provide opportunity for numerous outreach projects and public events.<br/><br/>How cellular processes can be explained by modularity remains poorly understood, partly because of the lack of tools for manipulating whole organelles. The project focuses on developing two types of artificial cytoskeletons (synCyto) that can be introduced into living cells and controlled experimentally, based on: 1) Spirostomum myonemes and (2) Magnetic particles (Magnetic Robotic Swarms). The prediction is that these will form dynamic assemblages inside of cells that can be controllable experimentally through inputs such as light or magnetic fields to change cell shape and move other organelles. This work provides proof of principle towards developing hybrid cells with multiple synthetic organelles. Such synthetic organelles promise to provide prosthetic function to replace or augment native organelles, and have the potential to confer new and enhanced cellular functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a pressing need in ecology and conservation biology to better understand the underlying processes leading to species extinction with the goal of developing predictive models for local, regional, and ultimately global extinctions. Although general threats to biodiversity are well-documented, there is less consensus about why one species may go extinct while others persist in response to one particular disturbance or threat. This suggests that the key question to understanding modern biodiversity loss is not what causes extinctions, but why do some species go extinct, while others survive? This study examines the loss of species from aquatic and terrestrial environments due to a variety of disturbances. These disturbances will include the loss of habitat area, and the introduction of predators and novel species. Mathematical models will be developed to predict and test for different outcomes. Of key interest is determining the degree to which the loss of species is due to chance events alone and the degree to which the characteristics of species that make some more susceptible to being lost than others. This work will engage undergraduate students in the development, design and implementation of each stage of the project. This research training of undergraduates in experimental design and theory and the use of modeling approaches will prepare the next generation of scientists to address pressing environmental issues. <br/><br/>Empirical data and perspectives provide conflicting evidence as to whether species extirpations and extinctions are best explained by random chance or by selective trait-based processes. This proposal uses artificial aquatic and terrestrial mesocosm environments to test a framework for clarifying when probability alone or ecological determinism, acting through species identity and traits, predict and explain patterns of local and regional extinctions. Through a combination of manipulative experiments, modeling and null analyses, this study will 1) test the prediction that local extinctions caused by habitat loss will be explained by species rarity alone; 2) determine whether delayed extinctions (extinction debt) after habitat loss are the function of random chance or selective, deterministic processes; and 3) test whether ostensibly selective disturbances, such as predator addition and habitat homogenization, may overwhelm the importance of random chance and rarity in explaining patterns of local and regional extinction. Understanding how and why species go extinct will allow for the prediction and prevention of extinctions, which is essential for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity."

The German cockroach is a world-wide pest with significant economic and medical impacts on society. It is a principal source of allergens that can trigger asthma and vector of pathogenic microorganisms, including antibiotic resistant strains. This project will delineate the mechanisms responsible for the rapid emergence of this novel behavior with behavioral, electrophysiological and genetic analyses. This research is the first in any animal to (a) characterize rapid changes in the taste system that have resulted in the emergence of a new adaptive behavior; (b) describe in detail a novel sensory mechanism where a single stimulus at the same intensity drives opposite acceptance and rejection responses by activating different taste neurons; and (c) characterize the best understood case of behavioral resistance in animals. Although behavioral resistance is often cited as a major impediment to efficacious pest control, the mechanisms that underlie behavioral resistance are not known. This research represents the clearest explanation of sensory mechanisms that underlie the rapid emergence of a behavioral resistance trait in animal populations. The findings are being incorporated into several textbooks and apps on Neurobiology, Behavior and Evolution.<br/><br/>Taste polymorphisms are often described as changes in sensitivity of gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) within a taste modality, with phenotypes ranging from highly sensitive to completely insensitive to a particular compound. The proposed project addresses a unique gain-of-function natural polymorphism that results in a highly adaptive behavior. The project will test the hypotheses that (a) glucose and fructose are processed as deterrents by GRNs, (b) different taste organs differ in their GRN organization, contributing to effective processing of tastants as appetitive and aversive stimuli, and (c) that the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie this neuronal change involves either mis-expression of sugar-gustatory receptors (GRs) on bitter GRNs or modifications of bitter-GRs on bitter-GRNs for affinity for glucose or fructose. Approaches and methods will include behavioral observations of tastant acceptance and rejection, electrophysiological studies using a single sensillum preparation, morphological studies using light, scanning and confocal microscopy, and genetic studies with artificially selected lineages of cockroaches. Genetic resources include 20 lines of selection-with-recurrent-backcrossing at each generation for avoidance of specific sugars, as well as lines in which these traits have been introgressed into a closely related species. Annotation of all chemoreceptors in the genome sequence will be followed by a Pool-seq approach, whole-genome re-sequencing and RNA-seq. Understanding the gustatory system of cockroaches, a primitive hemimetabolous lineage, will contribute to a broader understanding of insect gustation that so far has centered mainly on holometabolous and more highly advanced Diptera and Hymenoptera."

Understanding the factors that shape microbial communities is important because microbes play key roles in ecosystem function and in human and animal health. Despite numerous studies, our understanding of what drives microbial community assembly, composition, and dynamics are still lacking. Our gap in knowledge is, in large part, due to a lack of integration between the fields of ecology and evolution. Because microbes evolve so quickly both ecological and evolutionary pressures must be considered when studying microbial communities. Environmental factors, species interactions, and evolutionary dynamics all play a role in shaping communities. However, the relative contributions of each of these factors in driving microbial community composition remain unclear. This research will combine concepts of ecology and evolution to investigate what drives the composition of animal-associated microbial communities using the honey bee as a model system. The honey bee is an ideal model system for addressing fundamental questions about animal-associated microbial community dynamics for several reasons: 1) there are only a few microbes that live inside the bee gut, 2) all honey bees worldwide contain the same microbes inside their gut, 3) honey bees are easy to experimentally manipulate, and 4) all gut microbes of honey bees are cultivable in the lab. <br/><br/>Key to this research is our ability to capture community dynamics not only at the species level (alpha and beta diversity), but also at the strain level. Artificially inseminated queen bees will be used to create genetically controlled colonies that will be used for in vivo experiments (natural and lab). Community dynamics will be followed across different controlled environmental conditions (i.e. different genetic backgrounds and lifestyles) in which a host-associated microbial community can develop. Results will determine how each of these ecological factors influence microbial composition. The role microbial competition or colonization order (i.e. neutral vs niche dynamics) plays in dictating the community composition will be assessed via in vivo co-colonization experiments. The entire gene content (i.e. functional capabilities) of microbial communities will be analyzed to test the functional equivalency hypothesis, which is at the cornerstone of the neutral theory in community ecology. Additionally, the extent of microevolution that occurs within a host, and how this impacts community structure over time will be evaluated. Age, lifestyle, and genetically controlled bees will be co-inoculated with defined communities (different combinations of strains and species) and temporally assessed for strain and community level changes. Unlike most microevolution studies which are done on single organisms under in vitro conditions, this project will follow evolutionary processes within a natural microbial community. Overall, this proposal will bridge ecology and evolution by integrating concepts and approaches from both fields to investigate the forces that govern the composition of host-associated microbial communities. The broader impacts of this proposal have three major components that are set in the context of an institution that is minority serving. The first (i) component is faculty and student participation in, and organization of, outreach events through formal partnerships between K-12 schools and informal outreach activities. The second (ii) component consist of curriculum development to create authentic classroom research experiences for undergraduates, and the third (iii) component involves research training for underrepresented minorities in science (URM).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this day, the most fundamental and common way to accomplish this relies on organism names, making these one of the pillars of querying and managing our biological knowledge and data. However, the traditionally used names for organisms and groups of organisms, which are based in Linnaean nomenclature, suffer from two major limitations to their usefulness when it comes to integrating and communicating data. First, because they are simple text-strings, the meaning intended by those who coin a name and those who apply it is inaccessible to machines. As a result, exactly which organism a name is or is not meant to include is often ambiguous, and names are therefore often applied inconsistently. Second, there are many groups of organisms that do not yet and may never have a Linnaean name, but for which molecular or macroscopic characteristics have been discovered that constitute valuable biological knowledge. This project aims to address these issues by generating a mechanism, called phyloreferencing, that allows referring to any group of organisms of shared evolutionary descent by a machine-interpretable definition of the unique pattern of descent that distinguishes the group from all others. This project builds on more than a decade's worth of theoretical and applied research into phylogenetic taxonomy. With the recent synthesis and continuous update of a universal phylogenetic Tree of Life, phyloreferences will have immediate and broad practical applications for communicating, integrating, and querying biological data across the Tree of Life. In contrast to authoritative nomenclatural naming, the goal for phyloreferences is that users can construct them instantly for any group of shared evolutionary descent for which they wish to communicate discoveries. In addition to developing the phyloreferencing standard and supporting tools, this project also aims to create classroom-ready teaching materials and curricula for training biology students in the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of phylogenetic nomenclature. <br/><br/>The phyloreferencing mechanism that this project will develop uses standards and tools developed for the Web, specifically the Web Ontology Language (OWL), ontologies, and machine reasoning. Specifically, this work aims to develop phyloreferences as OWL class expressions consisting of sufficient and necessary conditions, which machine reasoners can use to identify subclasses and class instances. Ontology and reasoning technologies have already shown their power for biological knowledge integration and discovery and are increasingly being adopted for evolutionary research as well. As part of this project, a specification for constructing and computing with phyloreferences within an ontological framework will be researched, implemented, and tested. Phyloreferences will be designed with the goal that any element, whether node, branch, or clades, on the Tree of Life can be referenced in a way that is unambiguous and has fully computable semantics defined by patterns of evolutionary relatedness. The main objectives of this research include creating a formal specification for phyloreference and phylogeny encoding and reasoning in OWL; ascertaining correctness of the specification using small-scale tests verifiable by domain experts; and finally scaling the approach to a large-scale biodiversity data resource navigation proof-of-concept application. Specifically phyloreferences will be developed and integrated into Open Tree of Life, ARBOR and projects newly funded by the Genealogy of Life program. Results of the project will be available at http://www.phyloref.org."

Macrophages wrap themselves around a foreign particle, engulfing and digesting it. This process, called phagocytosis, involves both chemistry and physical forces. Though the process of phagocytosis has been well studied biochemically, this project takes a different perspective: it treats the macrophage as a machine and the phagocytic process as a mechanical event. What are the forces? How do they coordinate? How does the machine work?  Without understanding forces, we lack a complete scientific description of phagocytosis and, more broadly, the immune response itself. The project employs both advanced microscopic techniques as well as unique force measurement methods to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the macrophage in real time while simultaneously measuring the forces it generates. The data generated from this project will provide a more comprehensive model of this fundamental biological process that integrates the biochemistry, the structure, and the biophysical forces. Another critical component of the overall project is bringing the research to the public to help inform folks on the latest exciting science that is happening in the lab. Broader impact projects include a virtual-reality-based exhibit that will be developed at a local museum, and a week-long biophysics ?mini-term? that will be taught at a local high school. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to use advanced imaging and force measurement tools to reveal the mechanisms of force generation and mechanosensing in phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process through which macrophages, neutrophils and other cells engulf large foreign pathogen particles as a first line of immune system defense. To engulf a target particle, one or more distinct actin-driven mechanical processes draws in the target, surrounds and encloses it.  Along with biochemical signaling dynamics, phagocytosis is also driven by fundamentally mechanical processes involving forces and structural dynamics.  The most fundamental questions are unanswered: What forces does a macrophage produce? What actin dynamics and associated cell morphological dynamics give rise to them? How do external forces and mechanical environment affect decision making in phagocytosis? Measurements directly associating macrophage-target forces with actin dynamics are a crucial missing piece to developing models of the engulfment process. Within this project, a set of hypotheses will be tested that are guided by analogous mechanisms that have been proposed for other cell systems such as the ?molecular clutch? mechanism in mesenchymal motility which provides force generation as well as mechanosensing.  Measurements of macrophage force generation during engulfment will be performed along with accompanying high quality, live cell volumetric imaging of cell morphology and cytoskeletal dynamics. This will be complemented by use of soft beads as targets to measure local compressive and shear forces being imposed by the macrophage on the target.  Quantitative spatio-temporal correlation analysis of volumetric actin dynamics and force measurements will also be performed.  This will provide rich detailed data informing location and timing of the local dynamic actin remodeling that produce a specific macrophage force event. If successful, the project will produce a completely new dynamical atlas of the macrophage that maps the relationship of dynamic 3D cell morphology and actin dynamics with local force generation and mechanosensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be accomplished through a workshop for molecular life sciences faculty. In the workshop, participants will work with experienced colleagues who will provide training on the principles of effective question writing and, more importantly, work with them on illustrative examples and, finally, on the participants' own questions. An online community will be established to maintain contact between the participants and the facilitators to support the former in applying lessons learned in their classrooms. In turn, it is anticipated that workshop graduates will mentor colleagues interested in improving their own question-writing abilities.<br/><br/>Professional development of educators has the potential to benefit large numbers of students over many years. To provide training in effective question design for the molecular life sciences, this project will organize a one-and-a-half-day workshop for thirty scientists/educators in Summer 2020. The workshop will build on expertise gained by the organizers in designing and scoring the annual undergraduate certification exam offered by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The workshop will begin with an introduction to writing effective questions and corresponding rubrics, followed by hands-on practice in revising questions and ultimately creating new questions. A keynote speaker will discuss best practices in assessment. The workshop will conclude with reflections on the question-writing process and sustaining a community of question writers. Held in the Atlanta area, the workshop will be advertised to diverse undergraduate institutions, including minority-serving colleges and universities.

One important aspect of this regulation is performed after translation of mRNA to protein, whereby cellular proteins undergo modification (post-translational modifications, PTMs). In all forms of life studied, these modifications affect both the structure of proteins and their functions, including their participation in regulatory mechanisms. Identifying where these PTM sites occur is essential to correctly elucidating structure-function relationships. While wet-lab methods can test individual protein modification and function, computational methods are a promising high-throughput alternative by which to characterize PTM sites; thus, development of accurate and reliable PTM site prediction methods has become an important area of research. The project fits well with the mission and goals of the institution, as indicated in NCA&T's Preeminence 2020: ""to make a strong commitment to education while working towards a much more-intensive research-intensive environment"". This Excellence in Research (EiR) award will enable the project researchers to develop and establish an independent, high-quality research program that will impact the research experience and education of minority students at NCA&T.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop accurate Deep Learning (DL)-based predictors for the sites of three important post-translational protein modification events viz. phosphorylation, methylation sites and SUMOylation. This project aims to develop first an accurate DL approach for phosphorylation site prediction (one of the most widely studied PTMs) to tackle a host of key issues for adopting this method, including such factors as the required amount of training data, required complexity of the architecture among others; once the factors have been defined and trained on the phosphorylation data, the approach will be used to predict two other types of PTMs targeting lysine residues: methylation and SUMOylation. The project will provide insight into three important questions relevant to the use of DL architectures specific to applications in bioinformatics including: i) required number of training examples, ii) complexity of architecture vs. the performance, and iii) performance of hand-crafted features vs. simple features. In addition, the project aims to explore issues related to the use of simple features vs. more complex features that integrate biological observations, and best practices for the creation of negative datasets needed in computational experiments. The project will provide a novel and broadly applicable DL-based approach to predicting PTMs, producing more accurate and complete annotation that other researchers can then use to facilitate related biological studies.  New education and outreach opportunities will be created for enhancing educational offerings and skills development in students, particularly in DL methods and applications; student recruitment will focus on creating opportunities for  women and minority students at North Carolina A&T State University, the nation's largest HBCU. In addition, the project will establish an international research experience program for students, to visit research labs in Japan.

This project will tap into the developmental knowledge already gathered from parental songbirds, including the zebra finch model system, and focus the ontogenetic study on a closely-related, but obligate parasitic finch, the pin-tailed whydah. The aim is to test the general hypothesis that differences in neural architecture or processing between parasitic and parental birds reflect evolutionary tinkering, whereby novel traits arise by modification of existing networks and structures. Through experimentally manipulated exposure of juvenile parasites to songs, the prediction will be tested that conspecific recognition relies on hearing a salient species-specific character, termed the password. Detailed quantitative patterns of transcriptional change following password exposure, and throughout developmental landmarks, will be collected to identify neurogenomic signatures associated with the timing and induction of conspecific recognition and to more broadly define the molecular basis of experience-dependent or developmentally driven neuroplasticity. Critical acoustic and behavioral components of these data will be collected during a newly developed field course in Puerto Rico. Acoustic and video data will be made freely available through DataOne, a public data repository, and genomic data will be deposited into the National Institutes of Health's NCBI short read archive."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. This research focuses on the morphology of fish skin, specifically, the microscopic scales called denticles on sharks and rays. Denticles have many proposed functions, including protection from predators, abrasion reduction, and alteration of water flow over the body. Shape characteristics of denticles are known to differ among species as well as along different positions of the body within an individual. Denticle shape is thought to alter water flow along the body of fish, by decreasing hydrodynamic drag. The functional significance of these scales is of particular interest because sharks and rays use many different ways of swimming, and there are many different denticle sizes and shapes. By comparing skin form with function, the fellow will answer questions about fish biology, including evolution, locomotion, and habitat. The Fellow will gain understanding of fish functional morphology by learning new techniques, including robotic testing of 3D printed skin. The results will also be important for learning about underwater locomotion for human use. The Fellow will  work closely with the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy to develop a hands-on teaching seminar for young girls interested in shark research.  <br/><br/>The fellow will use elasmobranch specimens from the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology to conduct a large-scale comparative analysis of denticle shape. The Fellow will be trained in multiple three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques to examine denticle morphology of species that employ various locomotor modes (i.e. axial-undulatory and pectoral-fin propulsors). The Fellow will use gel-based profilometry, which determines surface metrology variables (i.e. denticle roughness) together with micro-computed tomography, to create 3D models of individual denticles along various parts of an animal's body. These models will be used in a high-resolution 3D printer to produce a flexible material for quantitative hydrodynamic testing to investigate the fine-scale fluid dynamics produced by the skin denticles. Understanding how the morphology of the denticles contributes to hydrodynamic function and the ecology of elasmobranchs is important for understanding the structural and functional evolution of elasmobranchs and to design more efficient biomimetic materials for underwater locomotion for human use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Citizen science includes the public in the use of scientific practices to investigate phenomena. Involvement in citizen science projects has been shown to improve understanding of the scientific method and belief that one can do science, as well as demonstrate the relevance of science to peoples' homes, communities, and lives. Thus, it provides a valuable opportunity to bring authentic scientific discovery into undergraduate classrooms to produce students who are job ready in the 21st century.   A lack of coordination among citizen science developers, scientists, and instructors, however, is impeding progress in the use of citizen science in higher education classrooms to a high capacity. This project will create a network of individuals involved in the development, implementation, and data end-users of citizen science projects to determine the best practices associated with using citizen science projects in higher education. The increased dialogue created through this network will improve not only undergraduate biology education, but also the generation of scientific data.  The project has far reaching impacts from diversity and inclusion, professional development, higher education pedagogy, curriculum development, and even citizen science project creation/management.<br/><br/>This RCN-Incubator will increase collaboration among diverse individuals involved with the development and use of citizen science, compile prior research showing the learning benefits of citizen science in higher education, examine known examples of how citizen science has been used in courses, and compile a list of tools needed to ease implementation of citizen science in higher education. These objectives will be met through two in-person meetings and four virtual meetings, as well as the regular use of digital communication. Final databases and syntheses will be made publicly available on websites and through a final peer-reviewed publication. The results of this Incubator grant will provide a launching point for a full RCN proposal to produce the tools necessary to ease implementation and better understand the contextual subtleties associated with the use of diverse citizen science projects in diverse courses and institution types. Having a formalized network of ambassadors for the use of citizen science in higher education should increase the number of undergraduates participating in citizen science, resulting in increased self-efficacy, content knowledge, and development of a scientific mindset.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research seeks to understand heat tolerance in corals through an integrative study on the combined effects of coral physiology and its microbial partners. Reef-building corals make up the 3D habitat structure of global coral reefs that are ecologically, economically, and culturally significant ecosystems. Notably, corals live in symbiosis with bacteria that contribute greatly to coral survival, and these partners can often shift in response to changes in the environment. Rapidly increasing ocean temperatures due to climate change severely threaten coral survival, but all corals are not equally vulnerable to climate change. Corals already living in extreme environments may offer insight into how corals that are tolerant to ocean warming might survive into the future when the global climate will become more extreme. The extent to which coral-associated bacteria may improve coral survival under extreme ocean warming is poorly understood. This research will help to reveal how coral-associated bacteria may help corals that are less tolerant to ocean warming to survive climate change. Additionally, the project will provide data that will assist scientists in planning interventions to protect coral reefs that are economically and culturally important to coastal communities. The Fellow, an under-represented Latina immigrant, will be exposed to resources not otherwise available outside of this project. The training plan for the Fellow includes co-mentorship from coral experts in the US and Europe, extending the Fellow?s scientific network and resources across two hemispheres. To broaden participation of others, the Fellow will serve as a role model and conduct mentoring and outreach activities for members of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The first goal of the project is to compare the composition of coral-associated bacteria in favorable and extreme environments by analyzing samples from coral species present in both inland bay and fringing reefs of Curaao, Dutch Caribbean. The second goal is to perform a reciprocal transplant experiment between favorable and extreme reefs in the Florida Keys Reef Tract, USA to determine how the bacterial community contributes to coral acclimatization capacity. Because studying coral adaptive capacity takes major, long-term commitments in the field, the third goal is to utilize a laboratory coral model, the Exaiptasia anemone, to predict bacterial community responses to thermal stress at different life stages. Sample processing includes DNA extraction, polymerase chain reactions (PCR), library preparation, high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and novel bioinformatics pipelines. In effort to broaden the participation of groups under-represented in biology, the Fellow will draw on experiencing a similar background, to integrate mentorship, inquiry-based learning, and outreach with the goals of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Just as human traits, such as height or eye color, are transmitted from parents to their offspring, cells can also show observable patterns of inheritance. The specific goal of this project is to understand how a cell's inherited traits affect its future behavior; for example, whether it will stop dividing or become a more specialized type of cell. As such, this work addresses a fundamental, unanswered question in biology that could impact multiple disciplines across the life sciences. The research goals are deeply integrated with community outreach activities designed to educate and engage a diverse group of students including underrepresented minorities. The project will produce an online game in which students from an urban elementary school will create 'family trees' for cells by tracing images of cells over time. Students will earn points for each successfully tracked cell while learning the basic principles of cell biology. In addition, the investigator will host an open competition in which local high-school students compete to develop the most accurate models of cell behavior using data sets produced by the project. Thus, this project addresses a fundamental problem in cell biology and provides opportunities both to teach underrepresented groups and to draw on their emerging interest in, and talent for, science.<br/><br/>The overarching hypothesis of this study is that, in addition to environmental cues, an individual cell's fate is strongly influenced by the sequence of events that occurred both within that cell's own lifetime as well as during the lifetimes of its ancestor cells. This hypothesis will be pursued by developing a computational model of single-cell lifetimes and lineage relationships and applying these models to understand, in quantitative terms, how a cell's individual and family history influences its fate decisions. The project will employ fluorescence time-lapse microscopy to quantify inheritance patterns across thousands of related cells spanning multiple cellular generations. Cells will be challenged with environmental stresses or developmental signals and the fates of individual cells and their offspring will be determined. With these data in hand, mathematical models will be used to: (i) understand how the lifetimes of individual cells are regulated; (ii) quantify how single-cell traits are inherited; and (iii) determine how molecular events in a cell's history determine its fate. The project focuses on the inheritance patterns of two single-cell traits: DNA double-stranded breaks (that generally slow progression through the cell cycle); and expression of a canonical pluripotency factor, OCT4 (that generally inhibits differentiation of cells and keeps them in a pluripotent state). Quantitative predictions will be validated through targeted experimental perturbations. Successful completion of the work will lead to the development of a new theoretical framework for understanding how critical events occurring throughout a cell's history shape its functional responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The genetic mechanism of telomere replication by telomerase is better studied in yeast and mammalian cells; as far from each other as those two organisms are, they in fact represent relatively recent branches of eukaryotic phylogeny. In contrast, in this study an ancient, deep branching lineage of eukaryotes, kinetoplastid protists will be examined. The organism of choice, Trypanosoma brucei, has telomerase with unique structural and functional properties, and result should indicate how this enzyme works. The project will encourage full participation from women and underrepresented minorities in science. Apart from training graduate and postdoctoral trainees, this project will also implement a three-year undergraduate program (BIOKEYS) in both PIs' laboratories; the major goal of this program will be to teach undergraduate researchers to value interdisciplinary sciences early in their research careers. In addition to gaining experience from designing experiments and problem solving using high-end technologies, students will be teaching and learning from each other as part of a research group.<br/><br/>Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme, provides the major means for elongation of chromosome ends (telomeres), thus counteracting the loss of linear DNA ends in each cell cycle due to incomplete DNA replication by conventional DNA polymerases. Telomerase has two core components, the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) that catalyzes telomere elongation, and the telomerase RNA (TER), which provides a template for telomere DNA synthesis. The mechanisms of telomere elongation by telomerase are poorly understood in Trypanosoma brucei, a deep branching Kinetoplastid. Therefore, this project dissects structural, biochemical and genetic features of telomerase RNA in T. brucei to understand the mechanism of telomerase regulation in early eukaryotic species. The recent discovery of the T. brucei TER reveals novel features exclusive to deep branching eukaryotes, suggesting mechanistic differences in the process of telomere synthesis between T. brucei and higher eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, this project: (i) investigates telomerase RNA structure at a single nucleotide resolution using NMR and SHAPE chemistry, (ii) defines key TERT contact sites on TER that are essential for telomerase function in T. brucei using HITS-CLIP technology, and (iii) establishes the functional significance of TR domains by genetic manipulations and telomerase functional assays. Overall, this research will allow significant advances in understanding the mechanistic details of telomerase evolution in protists."

Migratory birds coordinate their departure from wintering grounds in Central or South America to arrive at North American breeding grounds at just the right time. Too early and they risk experiencing severe weather from late frosts or blizzards. Too late and they risk missing the peak in early spring insects that they depend on to successfully raise offspring. For their part, insects such as butterflies also benefit when their emergence coincides with the springtime flush of new plant growth. The timing of spring has been shifting earlier in recent years, and this raises the possibility of mismatches in spring timing between birds, insects, and plants. A few local scale studies have suggested that such mismatches may be responsible for long-term population declines for some species, but the extent of this problem, especially over large areas remains unknown. In this project, the research team will combine information on springtime weather, satellite imagery on plant emergence, and multiple large-scale citizen science data on birds, butterflies, and caterpillars to perform a comprehensive evaluation of mismatches in seasonal timing between interacting species. This work is critical for understanding the potential impacts of continued shifts in seasonality on living systems. The work will also engage K-college students and the public through a new citizen science program, educational units, and outreach events focused on learning about the timing of seasonal changes. <br/><br/>The proposed research will be the first attempt to examine phenological mismatch across three trophic levels at a semi-continental extent. Local-scale studies have documented specific instances of phenological mismatch but fail to inform how mismatch consequences propagate across spatial, temporal, or trophic scales. Birds and butterflies provide the most expansive, long-term and detailed macroecological data sets on distribution, diversity, and demography. The project will unite multiple large-scale citizen science datasets for these taxa with targeted field data collection, and remotely-sensed climate and vegetation data layers, to examine the cross-scale and multi-trophic interactions that connect shifting thermal environments, phenological mismatch, and fitness consequences. This will be accomplished by: (1) assembling and uniting continental and regional monitoring and citizen-science databases for Lepidoptera and birds; (2) building spatio-temporal models in order to assess drivers of phenology, calculate direct metrics of phenological mismatch across trophic levels, and evaluate fitness and population consequences of those mismatches; and (3) testing the ability of generated models to predict phenology and population trends for focal birds and Lepidoptera across eastern North America as a function of tri-trophic phenological mismatch. Taking a macro-scale perspective on phenological mismatch is critical for understanding the range-wide impacts of sustained trends in seasonal timing. In addition to answering critical research questions on phenological mismatch the team will extend the impacts of their work through both specific training opportunities and broad-based education and outreach efforts."

This project inverts the metabolic engineering paradigm by harnessing evolution instead of fighting it. The investigators developed an evolutionary approach to metabolic engineering that enables bacteria to integrate their growth environment and their engineered metabolism. The approach is called Programmed Evolution because a population of bacteria is programmed with DNA software to compute solutions to a metabolic pathway optimization problem, and evolution is used to direct the bacterial population toward optimal solutions. The goal of this project is to expand Programmed Evolution by developing a new method for new riboswitch discovery, using the new riboswitches optimally express the enzymes necessary for e the production of new compounds, and developing mathematical models and computational tools to support both processes. These approaches will reduce the cost of producing useful compounds in metabolically engineered bacteria for applications in energy, pharmaceuticals, and bioremediation. This project will increase diversity for science education, contribute to a competitive and scientifically literate workforce, and has the potential to improve American economic competitiveness.  This project responds to the call in Vision and Change for more authentic undergraduate research experiences as undergraduates pose research questions, develop testable hypotheses, collect and analyze data, and communicate results. As they learn how to program the evolution of bacteria for metabolic engineering, undergraduate research students will learn how to program the course of their own futures as science literate citizens, educators, and research scientists.<br/><br/>Programmed Evolution is a modular system for the optimization of orthogonal metabolic pathways in bacteria. It uses combinatorics, fitness, and biosensor modules that can be developed and tested separately, used in combinations, and shared among research groups. A key component of Programmed Evolution is the riboswitch that transduces metabolic output into fitness gene expression and selective advantage. Most riboswitches used in metabolic engineering incorporate RNA aptamers discovered by the in vitro process of Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment. However, aptamers discovered in vitro rarely function in vivo. The investigators propose to develop Cell-based Exponential enrichment as a new in vivo method of discovering riboswitches that function predictably in bacterial cells. The new method introduces genetic variation in a riboswitch to produce a library, applies negative and positive selection, and characterizes the phenotype and genotype of new riboswitches. The significance of the new approach derives from its potential to advance knowledge of naturally occurring riboswitches and to discover new riboswitches for applications in energy, pharmaceuticals and bioremediation."

A mature body of theory provides insights into why such changes in life histories evolve, but far less is known about how. The central objective of this project is to identify the genetic and molecular basis for changes in specific traits during a substantive shift in life history. The study system is a group of sea urchin species that are very closely related yet highly divergent in terms of life history traits, including striking differences in fecundity, larval form, and rate of early development. This project uses cutting-edge technologies, including epigenetic assays, single-cell sequencing, and genome editing to identify changes in gene function that contributed to a suite of life history traits. These studies will provide basic insights into how life histories and developmental mechanisms evolve. Understanding how alterations in molecular mechanisms contribute to traits and to adaptation is fundamental science that has important applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.<br/><br/>Life history traits are a major component of biological diversity and constitute a fundamental set of adaptations in multicellular organisms, but their developmental and genetic basis remains poorly understood, particularly in relation to morphology and physiology. This project seeks to identify changes in the genome and in developmental mechanisms that produced a dramatic life history transformation within the sea urchin genus Heliocidaris, namely from planktotrophy (small eggs, high fecundity, feeding larvae) and lecithotrophy (large eggs, low fecundity, nonfeeding larvae). This genus is well suited to addressing the motivating questions because it contains species with dramatically divergent life histories despite very close phylogenetic relationships, and because the ancestral developmental gene regulatory network (GRN) of sea urchins has been characterized in detail. The goals of the project are to learn how critical molecular mechanisms of early development were altered during the course of evolution so as to accelerate premetamorphic the lecithotroph, and how they did so without perturbing other traits. These goals will be achieved by comprehensively characterizing regulatory states during development to identify candidate regulatory molecules and interactions that have been conserved or altered during the origin of lecithotrophy; experimentally perturbing candidate proteins (nodes in the GRN) to learn about their developmental function, likely interactors, and contributions to the origin of lecithotrophy; and identifying and perturbing candidate gene regulatory elements that may mediate altered interactions (edges in the GRN) to understand their molecular function and contributions to the origin of lecithotrophy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A genetic duplication can occur when an offspring inherits two copies of a DNA sequence from a parent who only has one copy; these duplicated regions in the genome are called repeats. Following duplication events, these repeats can subsequently diverge due to mutations that affect one repeat but not others. However, this divergence can be partially or completely counteracted by a phenomenon known as interlocus gene conversion (IGC). IGC increases the similarity of repeated sequences by copying sequence stretches from one repeat copy into the corresponding region of another. The role of IGC mutations in shaping how repeated genomic regions evolve through time is poorly understood. This project aims to develop statistical methods for quantifying and incorporating the impact that IGC has in shaping genomes. By doing so, this research will illuminate the forces that shape repeated regions in genomes and will assist in understanding the biological function of these regions. Project goals will be accomplished with the assistance of undergraduate researchers. These students will have the opportunity to visit collaborators at the University of Tokyo in a cross-cultural exchange. In addition, visualizations will be created to simultaneously teach the general public about statistical inference and the forces that shape genomes.<br/><br/>A variety of likelihood-based statistical tools for studying IGC will be developed and assessed. One goal is to learn how IGC varies among biological species and among genes. A focus will be on how IGC is influenced by whole genome versus tandem duplication. The research will investigate whether there are tendencies of some repeat copies to be donors and other repeat copies to be recipients during IGC events. Careful consideration will be made of how to accommodate IGC in detection of positive diversifying selection, divergence time estimation, and ancestral sequence reconstruction. The work will combine theoretical development, software implementation, and testing using a combination of simulation and empirical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Genes involved in adaptation or isolation between species are frequently located in regions of a chromosome where the ancestral gene order has flipped. These inverted chromosome regions block gene exchange between closely related species, which allows the genes inside them to evolve independently. It is not known whether those key genes are randomly spread inside the inversions or whether they are more likely found close to the edges or the center of those inverted regions. Circumventing the barriers to genetic analyses posed by inversions will allow researchers to learn the genetic basis of species divergence and adaptation. This project will use the Drosophila (fruit fly) genome editing toolkit to reverse the outcome of the evolutionary process and flip back the large chromosomal inversions that separate Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. This will allow unprecedented analyses of important species divergence traits linked to these inversions. This research will also have educational impacts in K-12 education and teacher training via collaboration with public school teachers from local minority high schools. Moreover, chromosome inversions cause many important human diseases. Understanding where the critical sequences lie is fundamental to development of treatment of those diseases. <br/><br/>An important mechanism that allows species to persist in the face of gene flow is the presence of chromosomal inversions. Although considered impermeable barriers to gene flux in heterozygotes, chromosomal inversions can exchange genetic material via double-crossovers or non-crossover gene conversion. Those processes should be more common in the central regions of inversions. Theoretical studies thus predict that nucleotide divergence between species differing by inversions should be higher at the breakpoint regions relative to the center, and that adaptive or reproductive isolation genes should also be more likely located towards the breakpoints. Tests of the first prediction have been conducted using population genetic or comparative genomic data, resulting in a range of inconsistent patterns suggesting that theoretical models may oversimplify the expected effects of inversions on recombination. Test of the second prediction, on the other hand, have been impossible to conduct because inversions reduce or impede recombination in hybrids, precluding fine scale genetic analysis of interspecific differences at those genomic regions. To overcome this limitation, this project will leverage CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to revert two fixed inversions between the sibling fruit fly species Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. The strains that will be generated will be used for genetic mapping of reproductive isolation factors (hybrid male sterility), and for an experimental evolution study that will test whether and how much chromosomal inversions facilitate the persistence of hybridizing species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The bacteria may manipulate their insect hosts? reproduction in ways that improves the health or number of female hosts carrying the bacterium. Relevant to this study, these bacterial ?symbionts? can sabotage host sperm such that fertilized eggs laid by females without the bacterium die early in life (?cytoplasmic incompatibility,? or ?CI?). Currently, two common, unrelated bacteria are known to cause CI in insects: Wolbachia, and Cardinium hertigii, the focus of this study. The main goal of this project is to discover the molecular mechanism by which Cardinium causes CI in insects. The benefits of this work are at least two-fold. Bacteria such as Cardinium target animal cell division, a fundamental process that can be understood better when examining how Cardinium interferes with it. Secondly, CI-causing bacteria may be used for pest or vector management. The CI agent Wolbachia reduces the susceptibility to viruses of insects that carry it, and is currently being introduced around the world to mosquito populations, with major implications for reduction of vector-borne disease and the global bioeconomy. The project will also provide engaging science education targeted for under-represented groups through outreach programs for elementary school (U Arizona Insect Discovery and Insect Festival), high school (production of a book ?Animal Manipulating Parasites at NC State, and Iowa State George Washington Carver Internship program) and undergraduate students (via research opportunities at all three institutions). <br/><br/>For Cardinium strains that infect Encarsia spp., parasitic wasps of whiteflies, genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes that are likely to be important in CI and/or symbiosis. The central hypotheses are that (1) Cardinium effector proteins involved in modifying host DNA during spermatogenesis are associated with the testes, and other Cardinium effectors involved with rescue of modified sperm are present in the ovaries of infected wasps, (2) the role of these proteins can be inferred by identifying the host proteins they interact with and (3) that the B vitamin biotin has a critical role in CI and/or the symbiosis. The project presents a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses with a diverse array of approaches, in four objectives: (1) Compare Cardinium localization and CI candidate gene expression in male pupal Encarsia, the ?modification? stage, with patterns observed in adults.(2) Identify Cardinium and Encarsia proteins involved in CI with differential proteomics. (3) Use heterologous expression to identify interacting host proteins of CI candidate proteins. (4) Investigate the role of Cardinium synthesized biotin in modification of host proteins. This project will shed light on the sophisticated CI reproductive manipulation by Cardinium. Cardinium has received comparatively little attention, but produces a virtually identical CI phenotype to Wolbachia with what appears to be completely independent eukaryote-interacting genes, a plasmid and not a phage, and an unusual type 6 secretion system. What is learned about Cardinium candidate gene function, expression and host targets will illuminate CI and symbiosis in both systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This four-year project will document and describe land plant and lichen diversity in the southern Philippines through a series of large field expeditions followed by taxonomic study and formal description. The project team will document the occurrence and abundance of diverse plant species through a combination of physical museum collections and high-resolution photographs. All images and locality data will be placed online in easily searchable formats. The project will also develop a DNA repository of collections made during the field expeditions for future genealogical studies. Project data will be used to assemble species inventories in different areas of the southern Philippines to both identify biodiversity hotspots and prioritize land management decisions. Diverse training in field and laboratory methods will be provided to undergraduate and graduate researchers in Texas and North Carolina to prepare them for diverse science careers. U.S. high school students will learn about biodiversity through a project-based curriculum that includes exposure to collections, digital data, and spatial analysis. Outreach, including online interactive programs through the Botanical Research Institute of Texas (BRIT), will disseminate research findings broadly within the U.S. and the Philippines to both scientists and the public.<br/><br/>This botanical survey of the southern Philippines will be conducted through eight major field expeditions. Herbarium specimens will be digitized and freely disseminated along with associated metadata and images of both living in-situ and museum specimens derived from the collections generated by the project.

The project will combine data sets from many separate research projects into an attractive Web site that makes the data available. This will make it easy for scientists and students to ask questions about water quality and river flow patterns across the continent. Researchers will use these data to study what types of watersheds are best at retaining nutrients, are recovering most rapidly from decades of acid rain, have the highest erosion rates, and have flow patterns that are least sensitive to floods and droughts. The lessons we learn from studying many watersheds and streams will contribute to more effective management of our nation's water and forest resources.<br/><br/>Much of the literature of watershed ecosystem science over the last decade has focused on gaining ever finer detail of spatial heterogeneity within watersheds. This fine-scale focus has identified many idiosyncrasies of individual watersheds but has not helped us develop general theories about watershed dynamics. Most watershed ecosystem studies remain rather parochial, involving detailed studies of individual or paired watersheds, or surveys of a small set of attributes across multiple watersheds. Macrosystem watershed science, or the search for general principles that describe the functional capacity and behavior across watersheds, has been limited. A major reason for this lack of large-scale focus is the challenge of data access and integration across sites. Our goal in this proposal is to create a synthetic dataset that merges all US watershed ecosystem studies into a common platform (MacroSheds) and to enable and train a new generation of watershed ecosystem scientists in the art and practice of macroscale watershed ecosystem science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
