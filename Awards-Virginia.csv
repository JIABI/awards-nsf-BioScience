Determining accurately how these traits evolved is thus fundamental to understanding earth's biodiversity, and to predicting how it might change in the future in response to changes in ecosystems. Although sophisticated analytical methods and tools exist for analyzing traits comparatively, applying their full power to the myriad of trait observations recorded in the form of natural language descriptions has been hindered by the difficulty of allowing these tools to understand even the most basic facts implied by an unstructured free-text statement made by a human observer. The technological arsenal needed to overcome this challenge is now in principle available, thanks to a number of recent breakthroughs in the areas of knowledge representation and machine reasoning, but these technologies are challenging enough to deploy, orchestrate, and use that the barriers to effectively exploit them remains far too high for most tools. This project will create infrastructure that will dramatically reduce this barrier, with the goal of providing comparative trait analysis tools easy access to algorithms powered by machines reasoning with and making inferences from the meaning of trait descriptions. Similar to how Google, IBM Watson, and others have enabled developers of smartphone apps to incorporate, with only a few lines of code, complex machine-learning and artificial intelligence capabilities such as sentiment analysis, this project will demonstrate how easy access to knowledge computing opens up new opportunities for analysis, tools, and research. It will do this by addressing three long-standing limitations in comparative studies of trait evolution: recombining trait data, modeling trait evolution, and generating testable hypotheses for the drivers of trait adaptation.<br/><br/>The treasure trove of morphological data published in the literature holds one of the keys to understanding the biodiversity of phenotypes, but exploiting the data in full through modern computational data science analytics remains severely hampered by the steep barriers to connecting the data with the accumulated body of morphological knowledge in a form that machines can readily act on. This project aims to address this barrier by creating a centralized computational infrastructure that affords comparative analysis tools the ability to compute with morphological knowledge through scalable online application programming interfaces (APIs), enabling developers of comparative analysis tools, and therefore their users, to tap into machine reasoning-powered capabilities and data with machine-actionable semantics. By shifting all the heavy-lifting to this infrastructure, tools can programmatically obtain answers to knowledge-based questions that would otherwise require careful study by a human export, such as objectively and reproducibly assessing the relatedness, independence, and distinctness of characters and character states, with only a few lines of code. To accomplish this, the project will adapt key products and know-how developed by the Phenoscape project, including an integrative knowledgebase of ontology-linked phenotype data, metrics for quantifying the semantic similarity of phenotype descriptions, and algorithms for synthesizing morphological data from published trait descriptions. To drive development of the computational infrastructure and to demonstrate its enabling value, the project's objectives focus on addressing three concrete long-standing needs for which the difficulty of computing with domain knowledge is the major impediment: (1) computationally synthesizing, calibrating, and assessing morphological trait matrices from across studies; (2) objectively and reproducibly incorporating morphological domain knowledge provided by ontologies into evolutionary models of trait evolution; and (3) generating testable hypotheses for adaptive diversification by incorporating semantic phenotypes into ancestral state reconstruction and identifying domain ontology concepts linked to evolutionary changes in a branch or clade more frequently than expected by chance. In addition, to better prepare evolutionary biologist users and developers of comparative analysis tools for adopting these new capabilities, a domain-tailored short-course on requisite knowledge representation and computational inference technologies will be developed and taught.

However, it is not always obvious when these causes are also responsible for extinction and adaptation over million-year timescales--the timescale primarily relevant to the evolution and maintenance of biodiversity. With increasing rates of global change, it is vital to understand how and why species either adapt and survive, or fail to adapt and perish. This project builds a bridge between the causes of evolution studied over short timescales and the long-term outcomes evident from existing evolutionary diversity with a new set of computational tools and resources for biology research and education. New models will integrate field, genetic and experimental studies with patterns of trait change from across the tree of life. The research will apply these models to comprehensive datasets in mammals and fishes to better understand the causes of trait change over million-year timescales. The research will also develop and implement freely available classroom resources that specifically address issues of scale and causation over short and long evolutionary timescales--educating the next generation of citizens and scientists to the pressing challenge of predicting how current global change will affect the long-term outlook of biodiversity. <br/><br/>Recent controversies suggest strong limits on what inferences can be made from macroevolutionary data alone. One solution to these limitations is to synthesize what we know about the causes and limits of evolution from field and experimental studies into macroevolutionary methods. This project identifies three ""injection sites"" where such information can be integrated into comparative models to elucidate the causes of macroevolution. The research will develop new models that integrate measurements of genetic variation, natural selection and population data with macroevolutionary scale data. It will also enable integration of biomechanical models based on knowledge of trait functions. By uniting macroevolutionary models with knowledge and data on how microevolutionary data affect the evolutionary process, this research will open new paths for studying the causes of macroevolution. These models will be further connected to the field of causal inference--which has revolutionized artificial intelligence by rethinking how statistical methods represent causation. Finally, the research will address unfilled gaps in biology pedagogy by developing and investigating how to make the non-intuitive shift from Mendelian genetics to macroevolution in biology curricula. This will be accomplished by developing and implementing novel, software-based Open Education resources across multiple institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The largest uncharacterized reservoir of phylogenetic diversity on the planet resides in cryptic lineages of Bacteria and Archaea, often referred to as ""microbial dark matter"", that cannot be cultivated in the laboratory and are only known to exist from cultivation-independent molecular methods. Understanding the physiology, evolutionary history, and environmental impact of these groups is a major frontier for future research, and studies in this area have already led to important discoveries in biogeochemistry, evolutionary biology, and cellular physiology. Advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing together with developments in the field of metagenomics have provided an unprecedented amount of metagenomic data that can now be mined to discover novel microbial lineages, but new computational methods are required for leveraging this ""big data"" to achieve these biological insights. This project focuses on developing computational tools to assess microbial diversity in metagenomic data through analysis of sequences of RNA polymerase (RNAP). RNAP is a high-resolution phylogenetic marker gene that provides accurate taxonomic assignments for Bacteria and Archaea and can be leveraged to identify and classify cryptic microbial lineages in the biosphere. This work will also involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students in computational biology and bioinformatics as well as the integration of these bioinformatic approaches into university curricula. <br/><br/><br/>Advancing our knowledge of the extent and nature of biodiversity on Earth is a fundamental goal in biology, and currently the largest uncharacterized reservoir of phylogenetic diversity on the planet consists of cryptic lineages of Bacteria and Archaea that are often referred to as ""microbial dark matter"". Recent advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing and metagenomics provide an unprecedented amount of ""'-omic"" data that can be used to assess the diversity and distributions of these lineages in the environment, but traditional approaches relying on small subunit rRNA genes are not compatible with these data due to complications that arise from sequence assembly. Given the massive quantity of metagenomic data currently available, there is an urgent need for the development of accurate and standardized bioinformatic workflows for the analysis of microbial diversity that are compatible with current metagenomic datasets. The goal of this work is to integrate research and teaching activities focused on developing software for the prediction and phylogenetic characterization of RNAP sequences in metagenomic datasets. This will be addressed this by 1) development and validation of open source software that uses custom Hidden Markov Models, gene neighborhood assessment, and machine learning algorithms to accurately predict RNAP genes from metagenomic data, and 2) compilation of an RNAP database for the fast and accurate phylogenetic classification of novel RNAP sequences. RNAP is the best available phylogenetic marker to use in metagenomic data, and this work will therefore provide a critical framework for the assessment of microbial phylogenetic diversity and evolutionary relationships. The impact of the proposed work will be maximized through the open-access distribution of software and data products on GitHub and the Virginia Tech library. Implementation of the software will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses at Virginia Tech to increase student involvement and participation. Additionally, this research will be conducted by PhD and undergraduate students, several of whom are underrepresented minorities. The professional development of these students will be prioritized through close mentorship by the PIs and attendance of scientific conferences and career-building workshops. Results of this research will be provided on the Aylward Lab website (www.aylwardlab.com) and GitHub site (https://github.com/faylward)<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the BDD can appear superficially to be wasteland with little variety, in fact it harbors many unique species, comprise the most endangered set of habitats in Brazil, and is being rapidly being lost to agriculture and other human encroachment. This research will be the first to synthesize information from species' traits, communities, and genetics to understand how the unique traits and communities of organisms living in the BDD evolved. Using a diverse set of approaches to study in detail a variety of animals, plants and fungi that today inhabit this broad swath of dry habitats in central Brazil, the researchers will evaluate: 1) what sorts of traits - such as body size, shape or specific behaviors - allow a group of organisms to succeed in a novel environment? 2) how the novel environment determines the set of organisms - the community - that we see today? 3) how organisms adapt genetically and morphologically to that novel environment? and 4) how novel traits, communities, and genetic changes interact to produce the variety of organisms that are seen in different environments today? Answers to these questions will improve scientists' ability to predict the impacts of a changing world on biodiversity. The project will foster new international research collaborations by engaging a large team of experts from the United States and Brazil and will also provide interdisciplinary research training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.   <br/><br/>To accomplish the four aims listed above, the project will first use a machine learning approach applied to hundreds of traits and lineages in the BDD to determine which traits predict evolutionary success - the tendency for xeric-adapted species to undergo evolutionary diversification. The project will then employ community phylogenetics approaches to understand how functional trait variation is distributed in the BDD, and will determine the evolutionary patterns and over- or under-dispersion of trait values observed in particular communities inhabiting the BDD today, as well as how traits are filtered across habitat gradients. Finally, the project uses a variety of genomic technologies, including whole genome sequencing and transcriptomics, to understand how organisms adapt to the more xeric habitats of the BDD as compared to close relatives living in adjacent mesic biomes. By linking evolutionary patterns in traits, communities and genes, the project will synthesize the functional, phylogenetic and genetic dimensions of biodiversity of the BDD and present a comprehensive portrait of its origins and evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many molecular steps are involved in going from DNA to protein, with the biomolecule RNA playing a central role. Indeed, RNA is now thought to be the ancestral molecule at the dawn of life, as it can both store information (like DNA) and act as chemical catalyst (like protein enzymes). A remarkable, evolutionarily conserved family of Sm proteins plays key roles in RNA processing, in organisms ranging from humans to ancient single-celled organisms from the Archaeal branch of life. Sm-mediated pathways vary in scope from mRNA splicing in eukaryotes to RNA-regulated inter-cellular communication networks in bacteria. In each of these pathways at least one key step is mediated by a molecular assembly built upon Sm proteins. Given the ubiquity of the Sm family in contemporary RNA biology, ancient Sm proteins may have played a role in the pivotal transition from an ancestral RNA World to the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) world of modern life. This NSF project focuses on Sm systems from deep-branching archaeal and bacterial species. Leveraging both experiment (biochemistry, proteomics, crystallography) and computation (bioinformatics, simulations), the project will explore what ancient Sm-based RNP complexes look like (structure), their assembly pathways and dynamical behavior (function), and the interrelationships amongst the many Sm systems and their RNA partners (evolution). The work will help discover how the Sm family evolved into a pervasive scaffold for the construction of RNA-based molecular machines. The project's long-term objective - to decipher the biochemical roles of Sm proteins in the early evolution of RNA-associated molecular machines - also will illuminate, in molecular detail, the potential roles of the ancient Sm family in facilitating the transition from a primordial RNA world to our modern RNP world.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Beyond its scientific impact, this project will educate and train over a dozen under-graduate and graduate students in primary research. Because the project overlaps several disciplines, including biology (RNA, evolution), chemistry (crystallography, molecular simulations) and computer science (bioinformatics), students will learn the biological sciences in a truly integrated and interdisciplinary manner: The driving questions are biological, while the tools and approaches are physical/quantitative. This same multidisciplinary approach, uniting biology and computation, is the basis for the project's central educational plan, dubbed UVaCompBio. The basic model of the UVaCompBio project is that undergraduates from the biosciences and the quantitative sciences (physics, chemistry, CS, etc.) will be paired into teams that work together on active learning exercises and mini-projects over the course of an academic term, and in several areas of computational biology (physics- and informatics-based). This effort will (i) prepare students from the biosciences for quantitative biology, and (ii) give undergraduates from the quantitative sciences a working appreciation of the fascinating nature of complex biological systems. That two-fold goal will, in turn, achieve the ultimate goal of empowering students to be fearless learners who can work at the interfaces between seemingly unrelated scientific disciplines. Thus, over the course of the project period this educational initiative will train scores of undergraduate students and, with an emphasis on quantitative biology and a minority outreach component, will simultaneously and directly address these two major goals of modern science education."

It is impossible to deduce the functions of these networks using intuitive reasoning alone. Therefore, scientists construct mathematical models of cellular processes that can be simulated in the computer. Unfortunately, it takes many years of careful study of the scientific literature and steady, incremental progress to construct detailed, comprehensive, and accurate mathematical models. This project will create an integrated computational - experimental framework that will significantly accelerate the process of mathematical modeling. The project will create several scientific innovations including (a) novel approaches to searching the space of model simulations to identify promising predictions, (b) computational techniques to efficiently plan experiments, (c) experimental methods that use these plans to rapidly test model predictions, and (d) automatic techniques to extend and refine the models to accommodate the results of these experiments. The project will benefit science by applying this framework to develop a comprehensive, new model that describes how nutrients control the growth of baker's yeast cells. Long term benefits to society will accrue from the use of the methods developed by this project to study any complex cellular system, e.g., those implicated in cell proliferation in cancers, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. <br/><br/>Computational cell biologists have constructed detailed, mechanistic, and predictive mathematical models of many physiological processes in living cells. In principle, such models can predict the phenotypes of novel combinations of gene mutations. However, this potential has not been fully realized for three reasons: (a) the number of possible combinations grows explosively, complicating the search and prioritization of informative mutants, (b) it is impossible to manually plan experiments to make and characterize thousands of mutants, and (c) automated techniques that can resolve contradictions between experimental results and model predictions are still under development. The goal of this project is to create a unique, integrated framework that will address these challenges by (a) systematically generating informative predictions from mathematical models, (b) computationally synthesizing high-throughput experimental plans to test these predictions, and (c) rapidly reconciling inconsistencies between model and experiment. The project will apply this framework to models of cell growth and division in budding yeast. This transformative approach will streamline and accelerate the mathematical modeling cycle. The computational approaches developed for synthesizing experimental plans will be broadly applicable to other organisms, including mammalian cells, that can be systematically perturbed using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9. Because nutrient conditions, metabolic fluxes, energy budgets, protein synthesis, and cell cycle regulation are central to wound healing and tissue regeneration, to the engineering of artificial tissues and organs, and to the expansion and spread of tumors, the methods and models we develop here in the context of budding yeast cell biology will be of great relevance to mammalian biology. The educational component of our project will infuse computational thinking into biology at the undergraduate level and encourage students with backgrounds in life science, engineering, or computation to consider systems biology as a career choice. The project will offer a 10-week summer research institute on 'Computationally - Driven Experimental Biology' to six undergraduate students, consisting of lectures on project -related topics and a single collaborative research project. Involving all the students in a single research project will expose them to team science and give them an appreciation of how computer science, mathematics, and experimental cell biology can be seamlessly interwoven to study cellular processes.

This is true for animals, just as it is for humans. The broad goal of this work is to resolve how social interactions can both improve and compromise learning and memory through changes in stress hormone levels. By studying how social experiences impact learning in animals (here, birds) we can understand the costs and benefits of social interactions in a variety of social animals, including ourselves. This project is important to the fields of neuroscience and behavior because we are studying the benefits of social enrichment on brain function and learning. Most prior work has focused only on the negative consequences of social conflict and elevated stress hormone levels. This work is relevant to human society because the basic physiological and brain processes in the bird species to be studied are shared with humans; determining how social conditions impact stress hormones and learning in birds will provide information as to how social interactions impact human health and learning. This experimental work in animals will specifically determine if and how social enrichment could improve learning through effects on stress hormones.

Despite extensive work on the role of evolutionary processes in shaping cognition and sociality, few studies have addressed the potential for social conditions to drive changes in cognitive performance and underlying neuroplasticity during an animal's lifetime. Moreover, most studies to date have focused on the potential deleterious effects of social conflict, without considering how social interaction may support cognition and brain function. Social conflict can impair cognition through the effects of elevated glucocorticoids on underlying brain mechanisms. However, the reciprocal hypothesis, that social contact may enhance cognitive performance by maintaining glucocorticoid levels in an optimal range to support cognition and brain function, has not been tested. This project will take the experimental approach of simultaneous manipulation of both social and physiological variables in a social songbird, the zebra finch (Poephila guttata), to resolve the consequences, mechanisms, and developmental origins of individual variation in cognition. This work will move us toward understanding complex relationships among environmental factors and internal regulatory mechanisms. Further, addressing how social contact and underlying glucocorticoids may enhance cognition moves us beyond a historic focus (now well recognized as being flawed) on the impairments caused by this endocrine pathway and builds upon a broadening understanding of the adaptive role of stress. Finally, this project will support the training of K-12 teachers and high school students from underserved rural communities in Appalachia by involving them in the research."

Despite this formative role, field study opportunities in undergraduate biology education are declining due to real and perceived student, faculty, and institutional barriers. This project, using river ecosystems as the immersive context, will identify and overcome these barriers by establishing the ""River-based ImmersiVe Education & Research (RIVER) Field Studies Network."" This network focuses on undergraduate education in and around rivers for three reasons. (1) Rivers are natural classrooms for interdisciplinary STEM learning; their processes integrate across biology, hydrology, geology, and coupled human and natural systems. (2) Rivers offer unique logistical solutions for many barriers to immersive field studies. (3) Rivers provide essential services to society but are among the most imperiled ecosystems. Addressing current and emerging challenges facing river ecosystems requires scientists and professionals trained to work across disciplines, technologies, and landscapes. Creating capacity within undergraduate biology education for immersive field studies in these critical ecosystems will advance STEM training and inspire future problem-solvers to address the challenges facing river ecosystems in the twenty first century.<br/><br/>The RIVER Field Studies Network Incubator project will build human and institutional capacity for active learning pedagogy and comparative river biology. It will enhance the quality and capacity of current programs by supporting communication and coordination of educational and research activities across disciplinary, institutional, and geographic boundaries to advance undergraduate biology education at multiple scales. It will work to overcome barriers of entry for underrepresented populations and students with differing abilities while developing tools to support the creation of river field studies at new institutions. It will leverage the resources of individual academic programs and professional partners to begin building the foundation for transformative network-scale capacity for active learning in river field studies. Examples of transformative network-scale capacity include: establishing cooperative agreements for student exchange across the network; creating a national comparative river field studies curriculum; and developing a plan to transition the network into a self-sustaining national organization supporting interdisciplinary river field studies. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Group living and cooperation between individuals improve group performance by enhancing reproduction, improving foraging success, and increasing the ability to defend against predators. However, it is also known that the relative size of the group matters. If the number of individuals in a group decreases, the benefits also may decrease, potentially threatening group persistence. This phenomenon is referred to as the Allee effect: a population or group is at an increased risk of extinction when the number or density of individuals falls below a certain threshold due to either ecological or genetic factors (or a combination of the two). On the other hand, increased populations and increased population densities also can be problematic because they enhance group vulnerability to infectious disease.  Allee effects have been widely studied and are known to have important implications for wildlife ecology but the connection between Allee effects and disease emergence is much less well understood. Understanding how group size and Allee effects drive infectious disease interactions is critical, however, to the conservation and management of endangered social species as well as to the control of emerging diseases that infect group-living species and threaten both human and animal health. In the research funded by this award, Dr. Kathleen Alexander (Virginia Polytechnic Institute State University) and her team will take an innovative approach to address this critical knowledge gap. They will integrate empirical field studies with mathematical modeling to investigate and identify principles and processes that influence disease transmission in group-living species. They also will establish international scientific networks linked to a comprehensive postdoctoral and graduate student-training program to produce multidisciplinary scientists with skills in international emerging infectious disease research, an area of increasing need. Other education components of the project include a structured K-7 educational program to foster interest and increase understanding of infectious disease ecology in children in the study region. The research project will also establish a foundation to foster collaborative learning between Botswana youth and undergraduate minority students in the United through interactive lectures and contemporary learning media including podcasts and social media. This program will link students from Botswana, where infectious disease deaths from HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis are common, and the United States where pandemic infectious disease is rarely experienced. Students will explore disease causation and control on a broad level with a focus on the common global need. This approach is directed at strengthening cross-cultural understanding and international leadership capacity in minority-driven scientific discovery in the ecology of emerging infectious disease. <br/><br/>To study the connection between Allee effects and infectious disease emergence, Alexander and her team will build on their long-term study of banded mongoose (Mungos mungo) in northern Botswana. The highly social banded mongoose is threatened with a novel, emerging tuberculosis (TB) pathogen, Mycobacterium mungi. This pathogen is closely related to the human TB pathogen, M. africanum, and causes high levels of mortality among banded mongoose, threatening the persistence of smaller social groups.  The research team will take an integrated methodological approach that links molecular genetic studies of the host and pathogen with population biology and behavioral ecology studies of mongoose social groups that occur across both protected and unprotected areas of the landscape. They will use this empirical study system to investigate and identify dominant factors, processes, and thresholds that determine the outcome of the interaction between infectious disease and Allee effects.  Research results will be used to develop a conceptual framework and advance knowledge and theory that can be used to determine if and when Allee effects should be included in models of infectious disease in group-living species and how these interaction should be computationally characterized. Results will be important to the management of social wildlife species involved in transmission of infectious diseases of importance to both animal and public health as well as to the conservation of endangered group-living species."

These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. Pigmentation has become a powerful model for exploring the origins and genetic mechanisms behind these types of patterns. For example, new information about insect development has been learned by studying the colorful eyespots in butterflies. In plants, the mechanisms of pigment production have been well-studied, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of complex patterns of pigmentation. Filling this knowledge gap is the goal of this research. This project will study two species of monkeyflower; each has flowers with strikingly different color patterns. What's more, when the two species are mated together, new intricate and complex color patterns emerge. Since these new pigmentation patterns are seen only when different species are mated together, it suggests that interactions between their genomes give rise to the new patterns. Exploring how such interactions between different genomes can produce unexpected new traits is a primary focus of this research. One master's student, six undergraduates, and six high school students will be recruited to carry out this work. These students will be exposed to high-impact learning opportunities as they are immersed in hands-on scientific research.  At least two of the high school students will be selected from a high school that specifically serves disadvantaged youth.<br/><br/>The pigmentation patterns in the hybrids of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus are too intricate to quantify using standard approaches. Instead, a new digital image analysis pipeline is being developed. This approach will be useful for analyzing spatial patterning in monkeyflowers and in other taxa. The researchers will use this new method to identify and quantify elements of floral color pattern in a phenotypically diverse F2 hybrid population. Next-generation sequencing will be used to map the genomic regions responsible for the observed variation in flower patterns. Because M. cupreus and M. l. variegatus also differ in yellow carotenoid pigmentation, the same phenotypic and genetic datasets will be used to identify the genetic basis of divergent carotenoid production, which is an important but under-studied component of plant physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This instrumentation will expand the scope of research in multiple departments at JMU and in neighboring institutions by enabling faculty and students to study the dynamics of molecules, cells, and tissues. JMU and most of its neighboring colleges are primarily undergraduate institutions and are committed to engaging students in learning through faculty-mentored research. Indeed, students are responsible for over 95% of the total research use of our core microscopy facility. The new microscope system will provide these students with exposure to live imaging and multi-fluorescence technologies unavailable elsewhere in our region, and will expand the facility's ability to increase research opportunities for undergraduates. This instrumentation will also enhance formal upper-division courses such as Human Histology and Environmental Microbiology by providing students with practical training in light microscopy techniques. Moreover, in an effort to expand our impact on undergraduate research training, we will work with Bridgewater College's Biology Department (a neighboring, small liberal arts college) to provide access for their upper-division courses. Finally, this microscope system will support science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education in the northern Shenandoah Valley region by enhancing the JMU Biology Department's local elementary school outreach program. This program provides K-5 classes with the kinds of science enrichment experiences known to pique early interest in science (but often only accessible to select populations) to all students regardless of academic readiness, language and cultural barriers, and socioeconomic status. This state-of-the-art instrument will be integrated into 5th grade learning modules focusing on the components and dynamic nature of cells.<br/><br/>The new fluorescence microscope system will open new investigative avenues for researchers at JMU and in the region by enabling the study of dynamic processes at multiple levels of biological organization-from molecular assemblies to entire organisms-and by accommodating multi-fluorescent-label imaging with a broader diversity of fluorescent probes. It will advance the research and training programs of at least 16 faculty members from three institutions and multiple STEM fields including biology, kinesiology, regenerative medicine, mathematics, engineering and science education. Projects that will be substantially impacted include: cornea tissue wound healing and regeneration; using molecular and mathematical tools to investigate cell- and organism-level responses to protein mis-folding (a component of many neurodegenerative diseases) in nematodes; genome reorganization during crustacean development; the relationship between stress and feeding behavior in mammals; and the role of endocrine signaling in the control of sexual signal production in snakes. The new instrumentation will also impact research in JMU's Kinesiology and Engineering departments, among others, as well as at neighboring institutions such as Bridgewater College, Eastern Mennonite University and the Marion DuPont Equine Medical Center."

But, because we cannot look at the machines or their parts directly, some of the details are incorrect.  The methods produce incorrect details in part because they were developed in the 'pre-genome' era, when our parts lists were far less complete, and in part because we use the parts-list from one organism (mouse) to help us identify the parts in another organism (rat).  But, if the first set of parts (protein sequences) has errors, those errors can end up in the second set, and as more organisms are studied, the errors multiply.  Incorrect protein sequences make it more difficult to identify mutations that may be associated with cancer and other diseases.  Today, protein sequence quality control largely relies on the accuracy of other protein sequences.  This proposal seeks to greatly expand the types of information used to confirm that the details (sequences) of the cellular machinery are correct, and to collaborate with the Uniprot protein sequence database to ensure that incorrect sequences are corrected and so that future analyses do not repeat mistakes.  The proposed research will increase researchers' confidence that exciting differences between phenotypes, such as diseased and normal cells, or different strains of food crops, are genuine, and not the result of mistaken protein sequences.<br/><br/><br/>The UniProt Reference protein sets are a critical resource, providing a foundation for advances in genome biology, structure/function prediction, and personalized medicine. But Reference protein sets have characteristic errors that can be amplified in genome annotation, reducing the accuracy of functional annotation and similarity search sensitivity. This project is a collaboration with the Uniprot protein resource that will develop novel strategies for identifying protein sequence errors; these strategies will be incorporated into the Uniprot annotation pipelines to remove erroneous sequences from Reference databases. Initially, errors will be found by integrating exon-boundary and Pfam domain annotations into BLAST-based similarity search results to identify currently recognized errors, such as missing/additional exons and partial domains. In addition, strategies will be developed to detect currently unrecognized errors, by clustering similar proteins and looking for 'outliers'. Lists of 'suspect' protein sequences will be examined by Uniprot annotators and classified as true or mistaken errors, and successful error detection strategies will be refined and integrated into the Uniprot annotation pipeline, reducing functional annotation errors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To go, it must assemble a motility apparatus and disable structures for attachment to surfaces. To stay, it needs to establish a protected settlement by producing building materials of its own to form a bacterial biofilm on a solid surface. This decision and its execution by bacteria profoundly impact our lives and society because biofilms can form on so many critical environmental surfaces.  This research project probes at the molecular level how a bacterium makes and executes this decision to either form biofilms or move by enabling its motility. Besides advancing basic microbiology, this project will allow integrated teaching and learning opportunities as well as interdisciplinary training of both graduate and undergraduate students. In addition, a variety of outreach activities will be performed to help diversify our STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the regulation of PilB by the universal bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP (cdG). PilB is an ATPase that powers the assembly of bacterial type IV pilus (T4P) as a motility apparatus for movement on solid surfaces. Additionally, Myxococcus xanthus T4P has been demonstrated to stimulate the production of exopolysaccharide (EPS) which is the major building materia of bacterial biofilms. M. xanthus PilB (MxPilB) would thus appear to promote both motility and biofilm formation, which are two alternate and mutually exclusive lifestyles of bacteria. Evidence indicates that MxPilB and its Chloracidobacterium thermophilum orthologue (CtPilB) both bind cdG using a conserved cdG-binding domain. The investigators propose a model wherein cdG inversely regulates the two seemingly incompatible and opposing functions of PilB. One part of this project uses M. xanthus to test this model in vivo combined with cdG binding assays in vitro. The rest of the project employs CtPilB as the model protein to analyze the interactions of PilB with cdG by quantitative and structural analysis in vitro as well as advanced imagining platforms including single-particle cryo-EM and high-speed atomic force microscopy. The successful completion of this project will provide insight into the lifestyle decision-making by T4P-motile bacteria that are present in numerous ecosystems and on many branches of the phylogenetic tree.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whether trees thrive or falter during drought depends on how they respond to these stressful conditions. Despite many studies of leaf-level changes to photosynthesis and water use during drought, it is still unclear how trees make integrated and coordinated changes at the scale of the entire plant. For example, trees that change the angles of their leaves can reduce the radiation load at different levels of the canopy, reducing heat stress and water loss. This study investigates the coordinated adjustments of tree canopy structure and physiology under water stress using drought experiments in both growth chambers and in a forest that has a rainfall removal experiment. The investigators bring together traditional measurements of leaf and canopy gas exchange with novel remote sensing techniques that measure canopy structure and physiology. This project will provide interdisciplinary teaching, training, and learning experiences by collaborating with a non-profit organization (Math4Science) that promotes STEM, creating videos of 3D forests, mentoring undergraduate students, and exposing K-12 students from under-represented groups to STEM research.<br/><br/>The degree to which forests will continue to serve as carbon sinks and mitigate climate change hinges on whether trees can make physiological and structural adjustments to cope with changing environmental stressors. Most research to date on tree responses to drought has focused on how trees alter leaf-level physiology, phenology, and carbon mobilization and allocation. However, trees also make structural adjustments in response to drought (e.g., by changing leaf angles) to reduce radiation load and leaf temperature. The work extends current research on plant water use strategies, which is mostly focused on physiological responses at the leaf or ecosystem scales, to a new dimension - canopy structure (leaf angles). The investigators aim to answer the question ""To what extent do trees respond to water stress through coordinated adjustments of canopy structure and leaf physiology, and by what mechanisms?"" combining measurements of leaf and canopy gas exchange with novel remote sensing techniques that measure canopy structure and leaf physiology, including the Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and the Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV). By taking advantage of both classical and novel techniques, this project will provide new insights into the coordination of plant response to water stress over spatial (leaf to canopy) and temporal scales (short to long term). Including mechanical responses in physiological studies of drought at the scales of entire tree crowns will provide novel mechanistic insights into drought-science and will facilitate building comprehensive mechanistic approaches into ecosystem-scale models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Billions of specimens (for example, plants, insects, and fossils) and their associated data (audio recordings of bird calls, field notes, geospatially referenced occurrence data, etc.) are held in more than 1000 biocollections across the United States. Until recently, these resources have largely been relegated to cabinets and drawers with few researchers, educators, or the public aware of their existence. The potential to digitally capture images of specimens and their associated data offers great promise to transform research on the environment, public health, food safety, commerce, and national security. Achieving the ambitious goal of digitizing the nation's biocollections and making them available to the broader community requires an organized, coordinated, and sustained effort. The resources created will engage a new community of users that cuts across traditional boundaries of biology, geology, computer science and software engineering and connects academic researchers with educators, policy makers, and the wider public. Cooperation with similar efforts overseas will result in a truly global resource. The purpose of this Research Coordination Network is to create such a community. <br/><br/>The NIBA Research Coordination Network will enable new research; create novel, cross-disciplinary user communities; and promote the development of software and cyberinfrastructure that will not only support collections digitization, but will have more general applicability far beyond the bounds of this field. Most importantly, it will create sustainable structures, capable of maintaining effort in this field over the long period required for full digitization of the nation's collections. The Steering Committee for the RCN will help to plan workshops and establish working committees that will evaluate and seek stakeholder input on the goals outlined in an Implementation Plan for a Network Integrated Biocollections Alliance (NIBA), a proposed mechanism for organizing and coordinating a sustained effort to digitally capture specimens and their associated data from biocollections. The RCN will engage the broader scientific community and public in an iterative process to evaluate the appropriateness and feasibility of the six goals articulated in the Implementation Plan for a NIBA, which include: 1) establishing an organizational and governance structure; 2) advancing engineering of the biodiversity collections cyberinfrastructure; 3) enhancing training of existing collections staff and creating the next generation of biodiversity information managers; 4) increasing participation from a broad range of stakeholders; 5) establish an enduring and sustainable knowledge base; and, 6) infusing specimen-based learning and exploration into formal and informal science education. The products of the workshops will include published reports and plans that will guide a national effort to build the infrastructure and implement NIBA. The new research communities and collaborations that are established through this RCN will stimulate the development of new tools, such as software or new data-mining techniques. As biocollections specimens and data become more publicly available, citizen scientists, government agency personnel, K-12 educators and many others will begin to access and use this information.

However, modeling and computational skills are rarely taught in undergraduate classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. This project will develop a training program that teaches thousands of students across the U.S. the foundations of macrosystems ecology through simulation modeling. Through the program, instructors and their students will learn how to quickly and efficiently run the models by using new resources emerging from computer science. Thus, students will simultaneously learn the core concepts of macrosystems science and develop the skills needed to conduct the next generation of environmental research. These concepts and skills will be embedded within teaching modules centered on the frontier of macrosystems ecology, enabling undergraduate students to contribute to high-level macrosystems research. Engaging undergraduate students in hands-on modeling activities with real-world applications translates into a workforce with increased data science, systems thinking, and quantitative skills.<br/><br/>This project will create a training program (MacroSystems EDDIE: Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry & Exploration) that connects undergraduate students with new computing tools to teach them the foundations of macrosystems science using simulation modeling. These tools will be embedded in stand-alone teaching modules that will be widely applicable to a suite of disciplines and undergraduate student experience levels. The proposed modules represent the first formalized macrosystems science curriculum for undergraduates, which will be rigorously assessed, revised, and disseminated broadly for maximum impact through a partnership with the Science Education Research Center. The modules will be designed around areas of active research inquiry e.g., interacting local and regional effects on lake temperatures, carbon cycling, the incidence of algal blooms, continental-scale water policy and students will be encouraged to develop novel questions at the frontier of macrosystems science that they will answer using simulation models. As part of the training program, the students will share their results with Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) scientific working groups to advance ongoing macrosystems research.

However, these videos frequently contain dozens or hundreds of cells, behaving in complicated ways not easily discernable to a human viewer. This project hosted at the University of Virginia is innovating computer-based processing to pick out these cells and analyze their movements automatically. By simplifying these tasks, this software will permit studying large quantities of data for meaningful patterns and rules governing these cells' behavior. A front-end interface and back-end modules will enable scaling these capabilities from single videos to enormous databases, limited only by available computing power. These new capabilities will help scientists uncover new insights about these critical cells, leading researchers closer to understanding similarities and differences in cell behavior among animals used to study diseases and disorders that affect millions of Americans. By bringing together biologists and engineers, this project also provides exciting new experiences for students to learn about the future possibilities at the intersection of these fields. Training high-school teachers in image processing and its applications provides this well-rounded experience to even more students.  <br/><br/>To help neuroscientists observe the behavior of neurons and glia in their native setting, this software will automate the processing and analysis of complicated movements and interactions among dozens or hundreds of cells in high-resolution microscope videos. The interface will be both scalable and efficient, permitting rapid application of video enhancement, segmentation, and tracking software to large databases of microscope videos. The content-aware enhancement will suppress clutter while preserving cell features. Time-series segmentation will identify both cell bodies and ramified processes as they move between video frames and slices of the z-stack. Transport theory will enable tracking cell movements and other changes without having to construct a complicated model that could bias the results. Plugins under development for common packages like ImageJ and Vaa3D will allow scientists to integrate these tools with existing workflows. A modular design will facilitate expanding and refining the capabilities of this software over time. These software components can track how cells such as microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells react to their environment and how these behaviors change during infection. Microscopy videos of mice, zebrafish, and other animal models will reveal insights not currently accessible due to the complicated behaviors of these cells. The collaborative nature of this project will provide valuable experiences for students embedded in the investigators? laboratories to learn more about image processing and biological applications.

However, the data analysis and modeling skills needed to successfully develop ecological forecasts are rarely taught in undergraduate classrooms. To overcome this challenge, this project will expand an existing, successful training program (Macrosystems EDDIE: Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry & Exploration) to teach students fundamental ecological concepts as they create forecasts for lakes and forests across the United States. Through Macrosystems EDDIE, students and instructors will learn how to use models, assess forecast accuracy with observational data, and communicate forecasts to managers and decision-makers. These skills will be embedded in stand-alone teaching modules that will be widely applicable to multiple disciplines and student experience levels. Macrosystems EDDIE provides an innovative new approach for teaching macrosystems ecology and has the potential to advance undergraduate science education across the U.S. By strengthening both students' quantitative skillsets and understanding of macrosystems ecology, this project will help develop a diverse, globally-competitive scientific workforce and enhanced infrastructure for macrosystems research and education.<br/><br/>The biosphere is changing at unprecedented rates, requiring ecologists to use macrosystems science approaches to make forecasts about the future state of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Macrosystems EDDIE will provide the training needed to make ecological forecasting accessible to all ecologists, from undergraduates to senior researchers, by distilling complex topics and skills to an introductory level via interactive tools and visualizations. The teaching modules will analyze aquatic and terrestrial data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to explore how the predictability of ecological dynamics varies among ecosystems and across different spatial scales. All teaching modules will be rigorously assessed, revised, and disseminated broadly for maximum impact through the Science Education Research Center (SERC). Beyond undergraduate classrooms, module teaching materials will be used by Ecological Forecasting Initiative researchers, thereby supporting collaborative, interdisciplinary science across multiple institutions. By teaching ecologists at multiple experience levels how to retrieve, analyze, and visualize NEON and GLEON data, our goal is to enable widespread use of computational research approaches while advancing macrosystems ecology and ecological forecasting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One platform cells use to sense and respond to stretch is the cytoskeleton.  This meshwork of multiple different proteins gives a cell its shape, yet is constructed in a way that allows flexibility and motion.  This research is focused on the role that the cytoskeletal protein obscurin plays in stretch response and recognition.  Obscurin acts like a tether, connecting far-away segments of the cell to each other.  Due to its shape, obscurin has the capacity to expand and contract.  There are two possibilities of how obscurin could move like this.  Obscurin could behave like a rope, and only resist stretch when significantly elongated, or obscurin could behave like a spring, and resist an ever-increasing amount of force as it is stretched.  Obscurin also can propagate biochemical signals, and there is circumstantial evidence that this function could be activated by stretch.  The PI will test both facets of obscurin function - stretch response and signaling.  Together, these studies will provide insight into how cells passively and actively respond to physical stretch. This work will be conducted primarily by undergraduate students, in an effort to train the next generation of scientists.  The data accrued here will be incorporated into a free education website, where others who do not have access to significant research support can also learn the technical skills of how to do this kind of research.  Additionally, the PI will develop a scientific ethics curriculum for undergraduates.<br/> <br/>Specifically, the investigator will study how obscurin reacts to physical stretch using both cellular and in vitro models.  Obscurin is composed of multiple stand-alone domains.  Many of these individual domains have been characterized extensively.  In Aim 1, the PI will characterize how these domains act in groups of two or three.   Using protein NMR techniques, the cross-talk between neighboring domains will be measured.  Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provide a dynamic model of obscurin's overall shape.  These experimental approaches will be complimented through computer simulations to test how these multi-domain systems respond to stretch.   Together, these experiments will detail how obscurin resists force.  In Aim two, the PI will test what effect obscurin has on the whole cell when the cell is stretched.  Cells with and without obscurin will be stretched, and the biochemical consequences of obscurin's presence in these conditions will be analyzed.  Together, these two aims will help define how obscurin behaves as a stretch resistor, and will answer the question of whether or not obscurin is a mechanosensor."

Proteins are delivered to the surface using a process called exocytosis and are removed when a cell internalizes pieces of its surface in a process known as endocytosis. Balancing these two events allows the cell to control which proteins are on the surface at any given time and makes it possible to add new material or remove damaged proteins that may be harmful. This project combines cell biology, molecular biology and genetic approaches to study poorly understood pathways for endocytosis, termed clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE), that are present in many cell types. Through this research, this project will provide cutting-edge research and training opportunities at many levels of education, including undergraduate and graduate trainees as well as high-school students. A major goal is to give young scientists the opportunity to see how the things they learn in the classroom can be applied to make new and exciting discoveries in the field of membrane biology.<br/><br/>This research project uses budding yeast, a simple yet extremely powerful genetic model organism that has provided insight into many basic cellular functions that are conserved through evolution, including exocytosis and endocytosis. Although yeast was originally thought to use only clathrin-mediated endocytosis, studies in a mutant strain where this pathway was blocked revealed the existence of a new clathrin-independent pathway. This second pathway requires numerous proteins including Rho1, which regulates polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and coordinates repair of the yeast cell wall. Rho1 undergoes cycles of activation and inactivation, and its activity can be restricted to specific sites within a cell. The relationship between Rho1 activity and location, and how these relate to its role in endocytosis, are poorly understood. Thus, this project will achieve several goals: (1) define the ability of proteins that regulate localized Rho1 activation and inactivation to regulate clathrin-independent endocytosis; (2) examine relationships between protein complexes that regulate exocytosis and endocytosis; (3) identify cargos that are internalized by clathrin-independent endocytosis under high osmolarity conditions that are known to facilitate this pathway; (4) examine the role of the osmotic stress response pathway in clathrin-independent endocytosis; and (5) identify genes that promote cargo internalization in mutant yeast strains lacking both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the known clathrin-independent pathway to determine if additional pathways exist. Overall, the results of this research will provide new insights into the molecular machinery that controls clathrin-independent endocytosis, an important but poorly understood process in all eukaryotic cells. Using a simple model organism such as yeast makes it possible to rapidly identify the key components of these pathways, which in turn will make it possible to better understand related pathways in other organisms, including humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even with knowledge of the properties of each individual component, these interactions create a challenge for predicting how changing one enzyme will affect the performance of the whole pathway and the growth of the organism. While synthetic biology has the potential to address certain critical national challenges, progress is hampered by a lack of mathematical models that can be used to guide the optimization of complex biological systems. This project works to optimize the mechanisms that incorporate carbon gas into cell material in order to develop an efficient organism for generating products such as fuels or pigments. The results of the experiments will then yield a computational model capable of predicting the effects of novel combinations of genes. This project will directly lead to specific improvements in an important biotechnological platform, while simultaneously demonstrating a generic approach to using computational biology to efficiently apply the power of genome editing to a variety of synthetic biology challenges. The project also will develop and disseminate computational tools via websites, publications, workshops, and classes that will make it easier for students and researchers to simulate and analyze metabolic networks to learn about fundamental quantitative concepts that underlie their function, and provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.   <br/><br/>Epistasis represents a critical challenge to optimizing biological systems. When mutational effects upon growth or product generation depend on the genetic background, assessing performance across the entire parameter space of any system of realistic size quickly becomes impossible. There is an immediate need for two linked developments: empirical techniques that can rapidly generate and assess rational, combinatorial variants, and kinetic modeling techniques to incorporate these data and to make predictions. This project will use this novel approach to optimize the function of the high-efficiency ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway that the team has successfully introduced into the model methanol-consuming organism, Methylobacterium extorquens. In this project, gene editing of a plasmid-encoded suite of enzymes will be performed along with deep sequencing to rapidly assess the fitnesses of a quarter-million genotypes with combinatorial variation in nine dimensions of expression.  The resulting epistasis data, combined with direct measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations for select variant combinations, will be used to infer the numerous parameter values in the kinetic model, which then will be utilized to predict which regions of parameter space would be more or less flexible.  These parameter spaces will be targeted and compared in a second round of editing, experimentation and evaluation. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

Speech-recognition technology dramatically underperforms human hearing in such conditions, which has been a barrier to improving voice-based computer interfaces and prosthetic speech-to-text assistive devices. This research will address this gap by examining a perceptual illusion called auditory restoration, in which the brain fills in words and other sounds that have been interrupted by brief, loud noises. This phenomenon implies that the brain constructs robust internal models of speech sounds, and that it uses them to determine what is being said from limited or degraded information. To learn how these internal models work, this study examines perceptual restoration in zebra finches, a species of songbird. Zebra finches employ complex vocalizations to identify themselves to each other, and need to be able to understand who is singing in noisy social settings. The project combines methods of measuring behavior and brain activity to probe the neural circuits underlying auditory restoration in finches. By identifying these circuits and how they are wired up, this research will give insight into fundamental perceptual processes that allow humans to communicate through speech, and more broadly, that enable the brain to construct coherent experiences from sensory information that is often incomplete and unreliable. A better understanding of the neural mechanisms of auditory perception also promises to enhance the performance of speech-recognition algorithms to facilitate communication. The educational component of the proposal addresses a growing need in the field for computational proficiency at earlier stages in training.  The investigator plans to implement a curriculum to encourage and support early exposure to computational and systems neuroscience, serve as a recruitment tool for systems neuroscience labs, and contribute to the university's goals of increasing data literacy and skills in data science.<br/><br/>Auditory restoration has been widely observed in a broad range of mammalian and avian species. It is likely to contribute to humans? remarkable ability to reliably decode phonemes from speech in extremely noisy conditions. The research will advance the understanding of this phenomenon by bringing a well-characterized animal model of auditory processing to investigate a well-established human psychophysical paradigm. The approach combines in vivo extracellular and intracellular electrophysiology with operant behavior to examine how bottom-up and top-down processes interact within the auditory cortex to support auditory restoration in zebra finches. Aim 1 examines how auditory experience affects behavioral auditory restoration. Aim 2 determines where the neural correlates of top-down and bottom-up restoration emerge in the auditory processing hierarchy. Aim 3 begins to dissect the mechanism by investigating how specific cell types and their intrinsic neural dynamics contribute to tolerance for noise.

While the beneficial roles of many microbes are well established, it is not yet known how these benefits scale up to an entire population and influence disease outbreaks in populations. This award focuses on a contagious 'pink- eye' disease of a common songbird, the house finch. Beneficial bacteria in the eyes of finches can protect birds from developing severe 'pink-eye'. This project examines how the dose of infection impacts the ability of beneficial bacteria to protect birds against disease, and whether beneficial bacteria on the eye can prevent or slow down the spread of this highly contagious disease within a flock of birds. Findings of this research will have important implications for understanding infectious disease outbreaks in wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.  Investigators will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the use of new genomics tools to identify beneficial microbes. Using this study system and others as examples, project personnel will work with the Science Museum of Western Virginia to design a permanent, interactive 'Friendly Microbes' exhibit that illustrates the many ways that microbes benefit their hosts. Graduate students at Virginia Tech will learn how to better communicate science by assisting with the exhibit design and summer workshops associated with the exhibit. <br/><br/>How the microbiome modulates population-level disease spread depends on how symbionts function in host defense across the natural range of infectious doses, as well as how both 'donating' and 'receiving' the pathogen during transmission is modified by symbionts. This award investigates individual to population-level effects of the ocular microbiome on disease dynamics using a tractable wildlife disease system: a recently emerged conjunctival disease of house finches. Using a suite of mechanistic tools and experimental approaches, this project will: 1) test how pathogen colonization dose mediates the protective role of the resident ocular microbiome for individual finches; 2) determine how the ocular microbiome influences the likelihood of donating versus receiving a conjunctival pathogen during pairwise transmission; and 3) quantify the epidemiological impact of the host ocular microbiome on flock-level infectious disease dynamics. Researchers will examine how microbial symbionts alter both host and pathogen phenotypes relevant for transmission and reveal mechanisms of symbiont-pathogen-host interactions that are most likely to influence population-level disease dynamics. The award will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students in population-wide microbiome research as well as scientific communication.
