The ways in which major brain parts that are structurally distinctive have changed over evolutionary time are also poorly understood. These knowledge gaps are partly due to the fact that fossil brains are rare and have been difficult to study. This project features scientists from three collaborating laboratories who will pool their resources to identify a set of invertebrate brain centers that mediate learning and memory. Structural and functional similarities and differences among these areas will be established across modern insect and crustacean species. The major question this research is answering is whether these brain centers share common genetic and computational attributes due to the brain?s fundamental organization being inherited by the descendants from a common ancestor; or, because brains that have arisen independently in different invertebrate groups are not able to perform certain functions unless brain areas that give them these same abilities have also arisen independently. These questions will be answered by precisely measuring the brain structures in fossilized invertebrate animals and comparing their basic arrangements with modern counterparts. The broader impact of this research will be to identify invertebrate proxies of the learning-and-memory brain centers found in vertebrate animals alive today, including humans. Identification of such proxies will inform us about how brains have evolved, and will contribute to a broader understanding of how memory centers are organized. The results will impact theories of, and research on, neural networks and artificial intelligence, and at the same time the scientists carrying out this research will develop novel strategies for identifying genealogical correspondence of brain structures across a very broad range of species. Brains analyzed for this research will be digitally reconstructed in 3D and uploaded to an open-source database for education and research purposes. The research will also provide advanced neuroscience structural analysis and genomics training to students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The neuronal organization and circuit properties of insect mushroom bodies are well known, as are their functional properties for learning and memory. While the existence of mushroom-body-like centers exist across arthropods, it is not known whether these phenotypically or genotypically correspond to the centers in insects. The planned research will identify mushroom body-like centers across a broad range of species, analyze their discrete neural arrangements, circuit organization, and molecular attributes. These comparisons will identify the species within and outside Arthropoda that possess functional and morphological correspondences in these structures. Transcriptomics will address whether phenotypically-corresponding centers share common genomic attributes, and whether there are unique genetic networks that define arthropod mushroom bodies or whether these networks differentiate mushroom bodies in different groups of arthropods such as in insects and crustaceans. The identification of broad phenotypic and genotypic homology of these centers across a broad phyletic spectrum would suggest an ancient origin of these learning and memory centers. Equally intriguing would be results suggesting convergent evolution of learning and memory centers across taxa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In principle, living systems can adapt via two mechanisms: evolution and learning. Learning is a potentially rapid and powerful mode of adaptation. Even the simplest cells can evolve, but can they demonstrate learning in the absence of evolution? If so, what modes of learning can they engage in, and how simple can learning cells or cell-like systems be? In setting out to address these fundamental questions about the Rules of Life, this project will help to define the essential biological nature of learning systems. This project will make important progress towards the bottom-up construction of 'smart' synthetic cell systems, with potential future applications across a wide range of academic, industry, clinical and environmental settings. A multi-disciplinary cohort of graduate students will be recruited and trained in interdisciplinary research, and a set of 'science & society' modules for bioengineering-related courses will be developed. Furthermore, the project will engage a broader public audience by developing hands-on activities related to the goals of the project.<br/><br/>This project aims to create synthetic cell systems capable of associative learning. Specifically, the project will develop a synthetic cell that learns to respond to a light pulse signal by associating it with the addition of molecules detected by olfactory receptors. Success will provide a proof-of-principle that genetically encoded information-processing systems can carry out learning tasks, and will generate a reusable library of learning circuit motifs. Modeling and design of associative learning circuits will inform the development of corresponding genetic regulatory circuit architectures. Multi-input chemical signals will be sensed using a library of olfactory receptor proteins, and the effects of membrane encapsulation on system behavior will be studied. Finally, an integrated Human Practices component will explore the relationship between learning synthetic cells and artificial neural networks/machine learning, from historical, conceptual and ethical perspectives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The presence and concentrations of these molecules serve as features when determining a diagnostic pattern for specific states of development or disease. The approach to biomarker identification taken in this research attempts to find a set of features (here, gene expression levels) that best predict an outcome (protein levels occurring in the condition). The identified features, biomarkers, can help determine the molecular basis for the condition. Unfortunately, false positive biomarkers are very common, as evidenced by low success rates of replication in independent data sets and therefore low success in such markers becoming important in applications such as diagnostics in clinical practice. We seek to radically shift the current paradigm in biomarker discovery by resolving fundamental problems with the current approach by using novel, theoretically well-founded machine learning (ML) methods to learn interpretable models from data, and follow this up with a systematic experimental validation system in model organisms.  The disease model we are using is for Alzheimer's disease (AD), an urgent national and international research priority. Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are the hallmark of AD, and their building blocks are Amyloid-alpha and tau proteins, respectively. These proteins can be measured accurately from human brain tissues, as can global gene expression values. At present, we lack an understanding of the set of genes that affect formation of plaques and tangles, or any protective or pathological responses to these toxic peptides.  <br/><br/>Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data indicate three fundamental problems with this approach. <br/>First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. <br/>To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data by 1) selecting interpretable features, 2) making interpretable predictions, and 3) validating and refining predictions through interventional experiments. This approach has the following aims:<br/>1. Develop NEBULA (network-based unsupervised feature learning) framework to learn interpretable features that will likely provide meaningful phenotype explanations from publicly available multi-omic data sets. <br/>2. Develop a unified framework, called SHAP (Shapley additive explanation), to interpret the predictions of complex models by estimating the importance of each feature to a particular prediction.<br/>3. Validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments using high-throughput assays of gene knockdown on powerful nematode models of proteotoxicity.    <br/>For further information see the project website at: http://suinlee.cs.washington.edu/projects/im3.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To correctly turn on and off the needed sets of genes requires coordinated action by several hundred regulatory molecules.  The regulators interact with the genome and with each other: understanding how this happens is one of the most important questions biological researchers are trying to answer. This project will use chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, which measures where a particular regulator is located on the genome: this may be zero, one or a few hundred positions out of the billions possible in a genome. Regulators often act together and one may change the action of another, so another part of the proposed work is to discover sites where regulators are co-localized. However, co-localization alone does not show whether regulators interact directly, or indirectly through an intermediate. The overall goal of this project is to develop a computational framework that identifies direct and indirect interactions among regulators, using thousands of ChIP-seq datasets. This framework will develop novel statistical and machine learning techniques to overcome the limitations of existing methods. The techniques that are developed will be applied to answer the following fundamental questions: How do hundreds of regulators interact with each other to regulate the genome? How do these regulator interactions differ across cell types? How do these interactions differ across different species (human, mouse, fly and worm)? The implementation of the new methods will be made publicly available to help many other scientists to study how the human genome works. This project is interdisciplinary in nature and has significant emphasis on interdisciplinary education, through project courses and outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>Identifying the interactions among chromatin regulators, such as transcription factors and histone modifications, is of paramount importance to understand genome regulation. To infer this network of interactions, this research will compare multiple chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets, each measuring genome-wide localization of a chromatin regulator. Co-localization may indicate that two regulators interact directly or indirectly through transitive interactions. To identify direct interactions, the proposal aims to develop novel network inference methods to infer conditional dependence relationships (i.e., correlation not explained via any other variables in the network) among a large number of ChIP-seq datasets. While network inference has become a commonly used analysis tool for other types of data, such as gene expression data, the immense size of the ChIP-seq data sets and the strong redundancies present in the data limit the use of existing network inference methods. To resolve these challenges, this research proposes a novel machine learning (ML) framework to enable network inference from large collections of ChIP-seq data: 1) efficient ML methods to infer the chromatin network based on the entire ENCODE ChIP-seq data that contain redundancies; 2) new ML methods to jointly infer the context-specific chromatin networks and the associated genomic contexts by incorporating other types of genomic data; and 3) new ML methods to learn a conserved chromatin network across species and predict chromatin factor interactions even if the factors are not measured in the species of study.

A central unanswered question in regulatory biology is how epigenetic information is decoded and used by cells as they grow and differentiate. This project aims to address that question by first developing experimental and computational strategies to predict how the genome and its epigenetic modifications are used and then testing the validity of the predictions.  The testing will be done through experiments in simple cellular systems, as well as in cells programmed to differentiate into components of the human immune system.  The results are expected to reveal regulatory ?rules? that can be used to engineer desirable cellular outcomes. The project will have educational impact by partnering with an existing program (Rainier Scholars, www.rainiercholars.org) to broaden participation in STEM by offering a pathway to college graduation for low-income students of color. In addition, research results from this project will be incorporated in development of course modules to teach design principles of epigenetic regulation at both participating institutions, the University of Washington and California Institute of Technology.   <br/><br/>Epigenetic regulation is central to all aspects of human biology. However, despite its centrality and the wealth of molecular information already collected, we still lack a predictive understanding of epigenetic control. This project combines synthetic biology, developmental biology, and computational machine learning approaches, to develop and validate predictive models of how chromatin state, sequence context, and specific regulators together establish gene expression state.  These models will provide three key benefits. First, they will provide fundamental biological insight into the architecture of eukaryotic gene regulation. Second, they will permit engineering of synthetic chromatin-based regulatory systems that provide useful functionality, including the ability to establish stable gene expression states. Such synthetic systems would enable cell-based therapies that utilize the machinery of chromatin regulation to establish, maintain, and change cellular states in response to environmental conditions, even in cells participating in immune responses and other complex processes. Third, these models will help researchers understand how eukaryotic organisms harness chromatin regulation to control cell state transitions in their development. This knowledge not only will enhance the ability to interface with the natural cell fate control circuitry, but also will reveal design principles for optimizing the function of synthetic chromatin regulatory systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Why this pattern exists has long been a fundamental question in biology. One possible explanation can be found in the very nature of the way that animals grow from an egg into an adult, i.e., in their development. The genes that control animal development interact in networks. Some genes in these networks interact with many other genes, while others are more peripheral and isolated. This project tests the hypothesis that most evolution in animal form occurs through changes in peripheral network components, and in the aspects of form that those peripheral components make, while central genes and their associated forms are conserved among species. To test this hypothesis, this project investigates the patterns and drivers of tooth evolution in an ecologically diverse animal group, noctilionoid bats. This project is expected to be among the first to characterize the organization of the gene networks that control animal form, and the impact that this organization has on the way evolution proceeds. This project is therefore expected to illuminate mechanisms that have shaped the evolution of animals over the history of life on earth. This project will also directly increase participation of students from underrepresented groups (URMs) in research and contribute to public education. These goals will be achieved by involving URM undergraduates from Puerto Rico in project research, training postdoctoral scientists in URM mentorship, and showcasing project results at the Burke Museum.<br/><br/>This project?s goal is to characterize and model the evolution of developmental GRN modules and resulting morphologies, using the radiation of noctilionoid bats and their molars as a model system. This project's central hypothesis is that a conserved core module of the molar GRN controls the initial formation of molar traits that are conserved across species, with evolutionary modification of network sub-modules leading to interspecific morphological variation. To test this, two aims will be completed. In Aim 1, the team will quantify morphology of developing lower first molars (m1) in representative noctilionoids, and adult m1s across all extant noctilionoid genera. Data will be used to reconstruct the development and evolution of noctilionoid m1 morphology, and identify conserved and variable traits over developmental and evolutionary time. In Aim 2, the team will map gene expression over m1 development in representative noctilionoids, functionally test the ability of observed expression differences in key molar developmental pathways to generate variable m1 morphologies, reconstruct GRN modules for bat m1s in computational space, and link GRN modules to m1 morphological diversity. Using data from both aims, the team will also use machine-learning techniques to reverse-engineer a computational model that will predict m1 phenotypes resulting from variation in developmental modules. Through this research, this project will characterize the role of developmental biases in morphological evolution within an adaptive radiation, functionally link shifts in gene expression to the evolution of morphology among closely related species, and generate a predictive model for morphological evolution across a hyper-diverse mammal group<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many plants and animals evolve traits that allow them to produce offspring through self-fertilization. However, this transition is thought to be a one-way street because self-fertilization limits genetic variation which prevents further evolution. This project will determine whether plants that primarily self-fertilize can re-evolve to be outcrossing. Highly outcrossing and primarily selfing species of monkeyflower will be compared for their genetic variation and artificially selected for flower traits that determine the rate of selfing. The project will involve undergraduates in the conduct of independent experiments and the analysis of genetic data, and new laboratory materials will be developed on artificial selection and genetic evolution for an undergraduate course at Washington State University.<br/><br/>Limited heritable variation in predominantly selfing populations is thought to be a primary constraint on the evolution of outcrossing traits. While declines in effective population size and the efficacy of recombination are expected with close inbreeding, there is scant information on their consequences for adaptive trait evolution. Constraints on the re-evolution of outcrossing traits in primarily selfing lineages suggest either that genetic variation is limiting or that such responses are possible but unlikely to occur. Outcrossing populations of Mimulus guttatus and selfing populations of M. laciniatus and M. micranthus will be subject to five generations of artificial selection for increasing the anther-stigma distance, a key outcrossing trait, and the realized heritability will be determined. Pooled whole-genome population sequencing of the control and selection lines before and after the experiments will reveal the comparative effects of selection on their genomes. This whole-genome information has the potential to critically link constraints on adaptation to the genetic consequences of self-fertilization (i.e., low nucleotide diversity and strong linkage disequilibrium).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major challenge in biology is to understand how specific genes and genetic mutations affect the ability of organisms to function in their environments. In some groups of plants, a red pigmentation called ""anthocyanin"" has repeatedly evolved, probably because of the benefits that those pigments provide to plants. In flowers, brightly-colored red pigments help attract pollinators such as hummingbirds. The pigments also serve as antioxidants which help protect plants from stress-induced cell damage. This research will identify the types of genes and mutations used in three repeated gains of red anthocyanin pigmentation in a group of monkeyflowers (Mimulus). It will address the question of how flexible evolution (or artificial selection, in the case of crop breeding) might be. Are there multiple interchangeable, equally good ways of achieving a certain trait, or does each different route to the gain of anthocyanin pigmentation come with its own unique set of costs and benefits? The project will provide advanced genetic and molecular training for teams of undergraduate researchers. In addition, one internship will be provided each year to a promising student from the local alternative high school for youth who struggle in traditional schools.<br/><br/>A primary goal of this project is to identify the specific genes and types of mutations responsible for the gain of petal anthocyanin in each of three species, M. cupreus, M. l. variegatus, and M. naiandinus.

The researchers will use transgenic transformation, followed by phenotype and fitness assays, to determine (i) whether the same gene is responsible for the repeated PLA gain in M. cupreus versus M. naiandinus, and (ii) whether the two distinct causal genes in M. cupreus and M.I. variegatus are functionally equivalent and interchangeable. Aim 2 will test whether the broader genomic regions (pla1 and pla2) are functionally equivalent. The researchers will use introgression to move the +PLA alleles (along with the associated genomic regions) into different -PLA backgrounds. The hybrids will be screened by phenotype and fitness assays to determine if the pla1 and pla2 regions are either equivalent or functionally distinct. Aim 3 will test whether PLA evolution consists of a single molecular mechanism or type of mutation. Chimeric transgenes, which combine +PLA coding sequence with -PLA regulatory sequence and vice versa, will be used to determine whether the causal mutation is coding or cis-regulatory for three evolutionary timepoints: within-population, within-species, and between species.

While beneficial microbes that live on and inside of plants play key roles in plant health, little is known about how a plants? ability to benefit from these cooperative microbes changes during domestication. Plant-microbe cooperation is not stable. In fact, plants have repeatedly abandoned cooperation with microbes over evolutionary time, and growing evidence shows that some crops evolve to depend less on microbes over the course of domestication. This reveals a gap in our understanding of the evolution of cooperation: what evolutionary processes result in abandoning cooperation? And why does cooperation with microbes decline for some plant species, but not others? To investigate how these symbiotic relationships differ between modern crops and their wild relatives, this project will use seed collections and genomic resources for legume crops ranging from soybeans to peas. The utility of legumes in agriculture lies in their unique symbiosis with rhizobial bacteria, which convert atmospheric nitrogen into chemical forms usable to plants, essentially fertilizing them. At least forty-one legume species have been domesticated. Researchers will compare domesticated legumes? ability to benefit from rhizobia to that of their wild relatives by using modern genetic and analytical approaches. These techniques will provide insight into how natural selection has changed patterns of cooperation between legumes and rhizobia during domestication. Legumes account for a quarter of global crop production and a third of human dietary protein. Understanding how and why rhizobial symbiosis has evolved during domestication will provide a critical road map for ways in which we could improve crop yield in order to increase our ability to feed our growing human population. Crop domestication is also a tangible example of evolution in action--domesticated species have provided an intuitive model for evolutionary biology since Darwin?s original arguments. Project research will engage undergraduates with evolutionary problems in familiar food crops. To increase the inclusion of underrepresented minority and community college transfer students in science, the researchers will develop a new Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) module on symbiosis and crop domestication and a new Science Scholars Program to recruit and retain diverse undergraduates in scientific research.<br/><br/>A paradigm shift in the field of mutualism evolution is a newfound appreciation for the frequency with which host organisms, such as plants, have abandoned mutualisms with symbiotic microbiota. Yet, little is known about the micro-evolutionary processes that lead to declines in host symbiosis traits. This project will use germplasm and genomic resources that exist for legume crops as a powerful system with which to investigate declines in plant symbiosis traits over replicated evolutionary lineages from wild plants to modern elite cultivars. By integrating approaches from phylogenetics, molecular genetics, quantitative genetics, and genomics, this project will contribute fundamental knowledge about the role of trade-offs, natural selection, and genetic costs in shaping micro-evolutionary dynamics in symbiotic mutualism. To elucidate the traits, forms of selection, and loci that underlie changes in legume-rhizobium symbiosis across thousands of years of evolution in agriculture, researchers will: 1) quantify how the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with rhizobia differs between leguminous crops and their wild relatives, 2) test whether legume symbiosis traits have negative genetic correlations with legume traits favored under artificial selection, 3) test whether fertilization relaxes selection on legume symbiosis traits or selects for reduced symbiosis, and 4) infer whether genetic costs of domestication are predicted to degrade symbiosis traits in crops. This work will pave the way towards integrating an understanding of the evolutionary forces and constraints that underlie dynamics between hosts and microbial symbionts into the mainstream of evolutionary biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By performing photosynthesis in the chloroplast, a specialized cell compartment, plants transform light into chemical energy and fix CO2 from the atmosphere. Furthermore, they provide the air we breathe by releasing oxygen, and they represent the main part of our diet. As sessile life forms, plants have to cope with constantly changing, often times harsh, environments. As average temperatures rise, drought and interrelated soil salinity become increasingly problematic for plant performance and agricultural production in the US and globally. Salt stress affects photosynthesis by destroying the fine-tuned ion balance in the chloroplast. This process involves transporter proteins but most genes encoding chloroplast ion transporters are unknown. Dr. Kunz and his group investigate a new set of plant genes and mutants to determine their role in chloroplast ion transport. Moreover, his group is building a genetic tool that allows for testing the relevance of all chloroplast proteins and entire protein families in plant function and photosynthesis. The tool will be applied to precisely determine the genes crucial for plant performance under salt stress. This research will provide critical knowledge and new strategies to increase crop yields even under adverse climatic conditions. Dr. Kunz engages high school students in his research to raise awareness for plant research and its significance for a sustainable future and to excite the future generation of scientist for the world's most fundamental biochemical process, photosynthesis.<br/><br/>Plant photosynthesis is affected by soil salinity but little is known about the genes involved and their potential to improve plant resistance. Salt stress triggers changes in transcription of nuclear encoded chloroplast genes and the chloroplast proteome. Physiologically, salt stress leads to toxic Na+ accumulation in plastids and outcompeting of K+ which disturbs chloroplast ion homeostasis, osmoregulation, and eventually diminishes photosynthetic efficiency. Recently, the first plastid K+ efflux carriers were discovered. Corresponding loss-of-function mutant plants reveal poor photosynthesis under control conditions but, surprisingly, photosynthesis is rescued by salt stress. This emphasizes the potential of manipulating plastid ion flux to increase photosynthetic efficiency during salt stress. However, this approach is hindered by the limited number of characterized plastid ion transporters, most strikingly a chloroplast K+ importer. One hurdle is the high number of gene family members in chloroplasts which often results in functional redundancy and a lack of phenotypes. This project will: 1. Determine the role of plastid K+ channel homologs for K+ import, 2. Define the genes responsible for the unexpected salt stress rescue of plastid K+ efflux carrier mutants. 3. Build and apply a full-coverage artificial library tool to downregulate all nuclear encoded chloroplast genes and gene family transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana and determine the genes responsible for plastid Na+ influx and low photosynthesis during salt stress. 4. Engage and excite high school students in plant science and photosynthesis by providing hands-on molecular biology training in the classroom and the laboratory."

The volume, velocity, and variety of biological data has increased dramatically. As a result, current and future careers in biology are now highly dependent on quantitative skills such as sophisticated mathematical modeling, ?big data? analysis, and computer simulation. The implication for education is that all biology students need educational experiences that build biological data literacy. However, due to the rapidly evolving nature of skills needed to interact with increased volume, velocity and variety of data, many STEM educators lack contemporary data literacy skills. Even fewer have training on how to use data in the classroom in a way that is accessible to students and helps them build data literacy skills. This lack of training is more pronounced for community college faculty who do not regularly interact with researchers who develop and use these skills. This project pilots an approach that has the potential to significantly improve undergraduate STEM teaching and learning not only by increasing faculty comfort with systems biology approaches, but also by network participants directly engaging diverse undergraduates in cutting-edge methods in their introductory courses.  This approach could serve as a model for future collaborations between research institutes and primarily undergraduate institutions that seek to increase minority recruitment, engagement, retention, and success along STEM pathways.<br/><br/>This project will bring together systems biologists and community college faculty to engage in professional learning experiences that draw on the expertise of both populations. Community college faculty will engage in a week of deep learning of quantitative biology skills supported by the members of the network who are quantitative biology researchers. The full network will then create curricular resources that engage students in data literacy modules to complement classroom based undergraduate research and assist students in building the skills to interpret large multidimensional datasets founded in authentic research contexts. The network will partner to implement these resources in community college courses that serve a broad range of students including populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields. The project will improve the preparation of community college students by increasing achievement and learning of quantitative biology research methods and improve undergraduate biology learning environments by enhancing undergraduate faculty teaching of quantitative biology research methods. Further the project outcomes will generate instructional strategies and curricular resources founded in contemporary quantitative biology research and an expanded network of undergraduate biology faculty and scientists at research institutes engaging students in classroom-based quantitative biology research.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experience-dependent plasticity of the synaptic connections between neurons is generally accepted as the cellular mechanism with which a neural circuitry acquires and stores new information, commonly known as learning and memory. This project studies the homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the positive feedback nature of synaptic plasticity, that is, the mechanisms that bound activity levels within an appropriate dynamic range to preserve the ability of plasticity near saturation of activity as well as near absence of activity. How such complex homeostatic tasks are accomplished in the brain is poorly understood. Here, these homeostatic mechanisms are studied in the cerebellum of the mormyrid fish, whose cerebellar circuitry as well as its outputs and inputs are well defined and accessible for detailed examination. Using a combination of electrophysiological, imaging, and pharmacological approaches, the investigators characterize changes in the input/output relationships of cerebellar Purkinje cells during long-term potentiation and long-term depression of synaptic input to these cells, and begin to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results will have broad implications for understanding of the neural substrates of learning and memory.  The project also involves outreach to Seattle area elementary and middle schools, to teach about behavioral plasticity of electric fish.<br/> <br/>Synaptic plasticity is generally accepted as the cellular mechanism with which a neural circuitry acquires and stores new information, commonly known as learning and memory. The most studied forms of plasticity include Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD). Hebbian plasticity operates in a positive loop, leading to runaway neuronal activity and requiring additional compensatory processes to stabilize the neural circuitry. Many forms of homeostatic plasticity have been suggested as providing such compensatory role. However, unlike Hebbian synaptic plasticity, the demonstrated forms of homeostatic plasticity require very different time courses to be induced (hours to days versus seconds to minutes). Furthermore, modeling studies suggest that the slow evolution of homeostatic plasticity observed in experiments is insufficient to prevent instabilities of Hebbian plasticity. This project examines rapid, compensatory synaptic processes that could potentially prevent the instabilities associated with the positive feedback nature of Hebbian plasticity. Using dual whole-cell recording in slice reparations of the mormyrid cerebellum, the investigator has found that the strength of a Purkinje cells output synapses onto their target cells is up- and downregulated following LTD and LTP at the same cell?s input synapses, respectively. Here, a combination of in-vitro electrophysiological, imaging, and pharmacological approaches extend these observations to examine the characteristics and mechanisms underlying this bidirectional regulation of a cell?s output transmission following Hebbian plasticity at its input synapses. Establishment of this form of rapid, dynamic homeostatic plasticity and its underlying mechanisms will yield valuable insights into elementary processes of synaptic plasticity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advances in genetics rest on observations made in nature or in the laboratory, and numerical representations of those observations inform scientific theories as well as the decisions made by conservationists, plant and animal breeders, forensic scientists and physicians. Turning data into knowledge is the realm of statistics, and statistical genetics is changing as fast as genetics itself to meet the challenges Mendel could not have imagined when he collected data on seven characteristics of peas. Human geneticists now have data sets with over a billion genetic elements per individual, and the statistical tools of even ten years ago are often not sufficient to reveal the underlying information in so much data.

Humankind has long been captivated by species that seem to help each other out, such as interactions between pollinators and flowering plants or our bodies and the microorganisms that inhabit them. Because such species affect each other's ability to flourish, we expect to see some coordination of evolution across species as each adapts to the changes imposed by the other. Some mutations should only be beneficial in the presence of the coevolving partner. However, we do not know how often these reciprocal changes occur because we often cannot observe them as they happen and in many species it is difficult to determine which changes were a response to a partner species and which were adaptations to other features of their environment. This research will answer these questions by observing these interactions evolve in a microbial system. The research will also result in the development of an active-learning module on microbial evolution to be used in general undergraduate microbiology courses and the development of two inquiry-based courses for undergraduates. In these courses undergraduates will test the effects of mutations that occurred during evolution on the ability of populations to flourish with or without mutualism, allowing them to learn fundamental concepts of evolution and microbial ecology and genetics in an integrated manner.  <br/><br/>The experiment will consist of a two-species community of the bacteria Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough and the archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis, along with single-species control populations. Replicate communities will evolve over 3000 generations. The population genetics of this coevoling mutualism will be determined by sequencing the genomes of each species at several time intervals. The level of adaptation of populations to the biotic environment will be determined by comparing the fitness of populations with past and future mutualists, by moving mutations of interest into ancestoral strains, and by reconstructing all intermediates along the main line of descent and testing their fitness with and without a mutualist partner."

However, how these proteins accomplish their tasks is not understood. Proposed studies will examine the regulation and function of these proteins in muscle cells responding to low oxygen conditions that occur during injury, exercise and hibernation. The work will be conducted using zebrafish larvae as a model system because they can be used to study the organization and function of fluorescently labeled proteins in living tissues. Data resulting from these studies are expected to provide novel insight into the mechanisms underlying how muscle cells respond to stress. Such insights have implications for understanding or modifying the limits of muscle performance, engineering, adaptation and repair in a wide variety of organisms. In addition to the new information generated, the project will also benefit society by promoting teaching, training and learning, and by broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science. Outreach educational workshops with area high schools will be developed and strengthened through conducting hands-on research projects with zebrafish larvae. Student conceptual understanding will be assessed through the use of pre-and post-workshop evaluations. Opportunities will also be created for high school students to visit and work in laboratories of active investigators at Washington State University and the neighboring University of Idaho. A summer internship will be provided annually to area high school science teachers who will learn methods for zebrafish husbandry and analysis of zebrafish embryonic development applicable to a K-12 classroom environment.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the studies is to test the hypothesis that the heat shock inducible transcription factor, HSF1, regulates expression of small heat shock proteins, which dynamically associate with cytoskeletal filaments in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in hypoxic muscle cells to preserve cytoskeletal integrity and muscle function. The proposal includes three specific aims. First the role of HSF1 in regulating muscle specific small heat shock protein expression in response to hypoxia will be assessed. To accomplish this, the function of transcription factor HSF1 will be manipulated and effects on hypoxia inducible small heat shock protein expression analyzed. Mutagenesis of small heat shock protein promoters will also be conducted to identify motifs required for hypoxia-induced expression. Second, phosphorylation-dependent interaction kinetics of small heat shock proteins with the cytoskeleton will be analyzed in hypoxic muscle cells. Mutagenesis of serine/threonine residues will be conducted and effects on hypoxia inducible phosphorylation established. Dynamic interactions of wild-type and phosphorylation site mutant heat shock proteins with the cytoskeleton and each other will be examined in control and hypoxic muscles. Finally, small heat shock protein expression will be altered in muscles, and cytoarchitecture and function of muscle cells responding to hypoxia will be assessed.

This proposal aims to uncover the basic principles that direct how organisms tailor their physiological responses to environmental changes.  Understanding why certain responses occur requires a precise map showing which genes are regulated in a given response and how they are coordinated.  Using prior NSF ABI support, the Baliga Laboratory at the Institute for Systems Biology developed an approach to create precise maps of gene regulation for any microbial species. Using this approach, they mapped gene regulation in a set of important organisms including uranium-reducing Desulfovibrio vulgaris, lipid-accumulating Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, yeast, diatoms, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The next goal is to see how well the maps work as tools to predict the results when manipulating complex behaviors. Effective tools have wide-ranging implications for biotechnology, agriculture and medicine. Initially, new algorithms and software will be developed to further refine the gene regulation maps and identify factors affecting gene regulation during environmental changes. The focus will be understanding how organisms switch on or off specific behaviors in response to environmental cues. The work will be performed in two organisms - E. coli, a well-known, widely studied bacterium, and Halobacterium salinarum, an extremophile that thrives in high salt environments; it will be readily applicable to all sequenced microorganisms that are of significant industrial, agricultural, and medical importance. Part of the project is to develop and disseminate new high school curriculum to introduce the importance of computational modeling in solving real world problems such as food scarcity and climate change. Diverse populations of students and teachers from a variety of backgrounds, including those currently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), will receive training and sustained support as they learn this interdisciplinary science. This curriculum and training is part of a program called Systems Education Experiences (SEE) that reaches thousands of students and teachers each month. SEE works toward cultivating systems thinkers who can tackle problems, contribute to a STEM-literate citizenry, and help build a more diverse population of STEM professionals.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this project is to develop a framework to elucidate and predictably manipulate the gene regulatory program of any microbe. In previous ABI-funded research, the Baliga lab developed a systems approach to reverse engineer the environment and gene regulatory influence network v2.0 (EGRIN 2.0) model directly from a compendium of transcriptome profiles. The EGRIN 2.0 model elucidates mechanisms for environment-specific transcriptional regulation of all genes with unprecedented nucleotide-level resolution, at canonical promoter locations and even within coding sequences and inside operons. Here, an approach will be developed to elucidate transcription factor interactions within EGRIN 2.0 and characterize how the topology of these interactions (i.e., 'network motifs') generates genome-wide, temporally coordinated transcriptional responses. These studies will be performed in the context of understanding how two phylogenetically distant organisms --Escherichia coli (a bacterium) and Halobacterium salinarum (an archaeaon)-- use distinct regulators to mediate physiologically different yet phenotypically similar transitions from aerobic growth to anaerobic quiescence. First, an approach will be developed to precisely map conditional binding of transcription factors to sequence elements within promoters of all genes in the genome (EGRIN 3.0). Next, EGRIN 3.0 will be used to identify, characterize, and manipulate topologies of transcription factor interactions (i.e., network motifs) to predictably alter oxygen (O2)-responsive state transitions in H. salinarum and E. coli. In addition to developing a generalized framework for manipulating a microbial gene regulatory program within any organism, the activities will test the hypothesis that similar environmental forcing drives convergent evolution of topologically similar network motifs in phylogenetically distant organisms. The high-level thinking and process used by this interdisciplinary group will be translated into curriculum and training experiences in the form of real-word cases studies for high school teachers and students. One of the goals will be for students to use experimentation and modeling to better understand the influence of environmental parameters (such as oxygen, nitrates, pH, light, etc.) on productivity and stability of food systems, such as aquaponic systems. Students, teachers, and STEM professionals will work together to iteratively develop and test curriculum and experiences through a modified Dick and Carey Instructional Design model. All curricula will be integrated with published national education standards. All needed technology, software, lesson plans and learning aides will be provided to teachers and students through multiple online sources, resource centers, and in-person and online trainings.

These range from internal patterns, like the repetition of vertebrae in the spinal cord, to external patterns like the stripes of black pigment on a zebra. Pigmentation has become a powerful model for exploring the origins and genetic mechanisms behind these types of patterns. For example, new information about insect development has been learned by studying the colorful eyespots in butterflies. In plants, the mechanisms of pigment production have been well-studied, but surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms of complex patterns of pigmentation. Filling this knowledge gap is the goal of this research. This project will study two species of monkeyflower; each has flowers with strikingly different color patterns. What's more, when the two species are mated together, new intricate and complex color patterns emerge. Since these new pigmentation patterns are seen only when different species are mated together, it suggests that interactions between their genomes give rise to the new patterns. Exploring how such interactions between different genomes can produce unexpected new traits is a primary focus of this research. One master's student, six undergraduates, and six high school students will be recruited to carry out this work. These students will be exposed to high-impact learning opportunities as they are immersed in hands-on scientific research.  At least two of the high school students will be selected from a high school that specifically serves disadvantaged youth.<br/><br/>The pigmentation patterns in the hybrids of Mimulus cupreus x M. luteus var. variegatus are too intricate to quantify using standard approaches. Instead, a new digital image analysis pipeline is being developed. This approach will be useful for analyzing spatial patterning in monkeyflowers and in other taxa. The researchers will use this new method to identify and quantify elements of floral color pattern in a phenotypically diverse F2 hybrid population. Next-generation sequencing will be used to map the genomic regions responsible for the observed variation in flower patterns. Because M. cupreus and M. l. variegatus also differ in yellow carotenoid pigmentation, the same phenotypic and genetic datasets will be used to identify the genetic basis of divergent carotenoid production, which is an important but under-studied component of plant physiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To function, an organism copies specific genetic information from genes in its DNA to molecules called RNA and then uses that RNA as templates to make proteins. Proteins are the molecular machines that carry out the work of cells and give cells their identities. It is not clear what causes the amount of protein that cells make to differ between individuals. It is known that this can be caused by differences in how much RNA is made. However, individuals may differ in how fast they make protein from the same amount of RNA and also how quickly they recycle protein when it gets old. The research will measure RNA and protein levels in two different strains of budding yeast as they respond to mating pheromone. It will involve both broad surveys of many proteins and detailed measurements of a targeted set. While engaging in this research, students at a primarily undergraduate institution and a postdoctoral fellow will gain interdisciplinary training in the emerging field of evolutionary systems biology. Students from a junior high school will also be engaged in scientific discovery; they will collect wild yeasts from the air and from tree bark and identify their relationships to each other in the fungal tree of life, fulfilling the requirements of the Next Generation Science Standards recently adopted by California and Washington.<br/><br/><br/>Specifically, the project seeks to systematically characterize the causes of divergence in protein expression temporal dynamics using a unique combination of high-throughput phenotyping, modeling, cellular resolution quantitative trait mapping, and targeted functional analysis. The mating pheromone response network of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used as a model system. The research will identify the contribution of variation in mRNA levels, protein production rates, and protein degradation rates to protein levels. Applying this approach to a network of genes will elucidate the general trends in how protein expression variation arises. Identifying the causal polymorphisms underlying protein expression variation will point to the molecular mechanisms for such variation.

Despite a steady increase in its holdings, the growth of the PDB is far outstripped by the growth in the available protein sequence data. Resources like Genome3D (genome3d.eu), funded by the BBSRC, aim to fill the gap in structure coverage of the protein sequence space with reliable predictions of structures. These approaches largely model proteins that are closely related to a protein of known structure. The Rosetta method for predicting protein structures, a world-leading approach developed by the Baker lab in the USA, was recently enhanced with information derived from evolutionary analyses of protein sequence data, yielding reliable models even for cases where sequence identity between the model and the available experimental structures is very low. This project will integrate Rosetta models into Genome3D to expand the coverage of structural data for important organisms for health and food security. It will also enrich both the experimentally determined and computationally predicted structures with valuable functional annotations, such as information pertaining to surface interfaces, a key ingredient in understanding how proteins interact with each other and with other biological molecules. By focusing on proteins dissimilar to those with known structures, this portal will help fill the gaps in structure coverage of the protein sequence space and will make structure data much more readily available and accessible. Finally, novel visualization tools integrating the presentation of the predicted and experimentally determined structures will be developed, maintaining a clear distinction between what is predicted and what is experimentally determined. <br/><br/>The expanded set of 3D models derived from this project will in turn help to expand the coverage of sequence space even further, since these models can be used to guide the experimental determination of protein structures being obtained by powerful new structural biology techniques like cryo-Electron Microscopy (EM).

Scientists in both academia and industrial sectors will benefit from access to such an integrated portal, assisting them in designing new medicines, understanding the mechanism of disease, or in designing proteins with novel properties. Recent advances in Electron Microscopy allows near routine determination of structures of large molecular machines and is in need of a large repertoire of ""building blocks"" in interpreting the experimental results, a need which will be partially addressed by the new portal and its provision of expanded domain structure libraries.

Thus, many aspects of ""egg quality"", the term used to describe an egg that can be successively fertilized and lead to a viable offspring, are determined relatively early. The project will use ovaries from a non-mammalian vertebrate model to determine how early oocyte growth is regulated by hormones. Because of the conserved nature of egg development in vertebrates, the research will improve fundamental knowledge of egg development in vertebrates, including humans and agriculturally important animals, and may lead to the development of improved methods to overcome reproductive dysfunction of captive-reared fish in conservation and commercial aquaculture. The project will integrate research and education by recruiting undergraduate and graduate students from California State University Fullerton, a Hispanic Serving Institution, to work with a diverse group of scientists from the University of Washington, and with researchers from a federal agency. The goal is to train the next generation of scientists how to apply molecular tools, bioinformatics, and histology to biological questions while gaining an in-depth understanding of animal physiology, endocrinology, and reproduction. The research will be presented to the scientific community and to the public via established partnerships to provide trainees with service-learning experience.<br/><br/>The basic physiology of female teleost reproduction, particularly during the later stages of oogenesis (e.g., vitellogenesis, maturation, ovulation) is fairly well understood. By contrast, comparatively little is known about the transition into puberty. In the ovary, this occurs when the primary growth ovarian follicles (containing developing oocytes) are recruited into secondary growth. Using a well-characterized in vitro model using coho salmon ovarian explants, the investigators have shown that 11-ketotestosterone (11KT), a teleost-specific aromatizable androgen, promotes the development of primary and early secondary ovarian follicles, associated with identification via RNA-Seq of altered mRNA levels of hundreds to thousands of genes, depending on stage. These changes are consistent with altered hormonal signaling pathways, tissue remodeling, and the progression to an early secondary ovarian follicle phenotype. The project will further explore the hypothesis that androgens are essential for early ovarian follicle by exploiting advances in proteomics, quantitative steroid biochemical analyses and the availability of homologous recombinant gonadotropins to: characterize the major endogenous androgens present in the female coho salmon during the onset of puberty; characterize androgen receptors; document the development-related changes in ovarian follicle proteins using cutting-edge proteomics; and explore the potential roles of gonadotropins in regulating previtellogenic ovarian follicle development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photorespiration is a plant process that recycles toxic products created as a byproduct of photosynthesis and is an essential process of plant growth. Rates of photorespiration are linked to elevated temperature and carbon dioxide concentration, meaning that future rates of photorespiration will change with changing climates. One carbon metabolism is similarly vital to plant growth, and also is the source for essential vitamins like folate. The goal of this project is to generate models predicting how current and future climatic conditions influence plant performance and yields. These models would inform breeding and engineering approaches to optimize plant productivity and the production of plant compounds important for human nutrition and health. During this interdisciplinary project, high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees are taught integrative approaches to plant biology, broadening their education and learning opportunities in collaborative scientific research. The aim of this activity is to instill positive attitudes towards science, and encourage creative and critical thinking by providing trainees with greater access to the scientific process early in their educational training. Underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students participate in several university programs designed to provide information on existing research opportunities to underrepresented groups at Washington State University and Michigan State University. The main public facing outreach activity of this project is a Sounds of Science performance at Washington State University, a unique collaboration between plant scientists and musicians resulting in a TED-talk styled event aimed to increase awareness of the importance of plant science. <br/><br/>Traditionally, photorespiration has been considered well defined with little metabolic flexibility. However, the PI?s recent work suggests that photorespiratory flux can alternatively be partitioned into the metabolism of tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon (C1) units in the cytosol. This may provide an overflow for the traditional photorespiratory pathway and has important implications for the energetics and carbon balance of photorespiration, photosynthesis, and foliar nitrogen assimilation. Therefore, it is important to define the contribution of cytosolic C1 metabolism to photorespiration, particularly in response to conditions that influence rates of photorespiration (e.g. drought and high temperature). The goal of the project is to determine the role of cytosolic C1 metabolism in photorespiration. It is hypothesized that two cytosolic C1 enzymes, formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, participate in processing of formate and serine generated during photorespiration. Reverse genetics, leaf gas exchange, metabolite analyses, and labeling-assisted metabolic flux analysis are used to test the role of these two enzymes in the coordination of carbon metabolism between the C1 and photorespiratory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PULSE seeks to stimulate life science departments to undertake the type of transformative changes recommended by Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action (AAAS, 2011). Fellows from two-year colleges, liberal arts colleges, comprehensive universities and research universities were selected as PULSE Leadership Fellows, and they worked during the 2012-13 year to develop approaches to help departments implement recommendations made in the Vision and Change report. Such improvements in how biology is taught at all types of undergraduate institutions are expected to lead to increases in:  1)  student learning of core concepts in the life sciences, 2) retention rates for students in the life sciences, and 3) preparation for all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens.  <br/><br/>Although individual faculty members have been very active in instituting reforms in their classrooms, departmental and institutional transformation has been more difficult. This proposal will address this challenge by creating a network of institutions in geographical proximity so they can support and advise one another as each moves to implement departmental change.  Tools and resources have been developed by the PULSE Leadership Fellows that will be field-tested by the different types of participating institutions in the Northwest. For example, rubrics for departmental self-assessment and visits by trained Ambassadors will be provided to assist departments in adopting reforms in how life science courses are taught. During each year of this award, fifteen participating institutions from across the spectrum of Institutions of Higher Education will identify teams of faculty, administrators, and students to participate in on-line training sessions, in-person workshops, and follow up activities, including a regional symposium for biology instructors. The NW PULSE efforts target change at the department level and a key aspect is training in a systems-thinking approach.  This enables institutional teams to recognize their department as a system whose behavior they can influence and helps them to understand and identify leverage points, thus empowering them to act as change agents at their home institutions. It is hoped that this Community of Practice will increase awareness of the recommendations made in the Vision and Change report, accelerate the pace of adopting those recommendations by different departments, and lead to a better understanding of how change happens on diverse campuses. Results from the network's activities will be shared with the life sciences community, primarily via the www.pulsecommunity.org website and by continued partnerships with other groups advocating for change in life science education in the Northwest.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/"

Wnt signaling is a group of highly conserved biochemical signal transduction pathways known for their involvement in various embryonic processes. The presence of Wnt signaling elements in the mature brain suggests that Wnt signaling may also play a role in the regulation of brain functions in the adult. This project examines the role and mechanisms of action of Wnt signaling in the mature brain, from the receptors through which Wnt initiates signal transduction to the targets of the transduction process, such as proteins critically involved in synaptic communication and plasticity. The findings provide insights into how signaling pathways involved in embryonic development are re-deployed to effect lasting modifications in adult organisms. They also inform the development of treatments for conditions in which synaptic transmission is compromised. In addition, the project provides training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers from underrepresented groups, with the goal of increasing their participation in science professions.<br/><br/>Wnt signaling is a highly conserved signal transduction mechanism that regulates embryonic development of metazoans; however, the sustained expression of Wnt signaling components in the mature central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates suggests that Wnt signaling cascades might also play a part in regulating brain function beyond embryonic development.  Recent findings by the investigator indicate that a non-canonical Wnt ligand upregulates synaptic currents mediated by NMDA-type glutamate receptors. This regulation requires Wnt receptor RoR2, an increase in intracellular Ca2+, and activation of PKC and JNK. The objectives of this project are to: (1) determine how the Wnt receptor RoR2 is activated and whether it is sufficient to initiate the signaling cascade leading to regulation of glutamatergic synaptic transmission, and (2) unravel the signaling cascade triggered by activation of RoR2 receptors.  To achieve these objectives, a range of approaches are applied, including biochemical techniques, live fluorescence Frster resonance energy transfer (FRET), in some experiments combined with FRET based biosensors, Ca2+ imaging, and electrophysiology. Understanding how RoR2 signals in the mature CNS of vertebrates provides insight into Wnt signaling in general, contributes to better understanding of the regulation of synaptic plasticity, and ultimately offers proof-of-principle evidence for a general process by which biological mechanisms used early in an organism's life can be coopted in the mature organism for homeostatic processes or new biological functions.

For many coastal communities, they are a source of income, a shield against storm damage, and a cultural icon. For more than 240 million years, the growth of stony corals engineered these ecosystems. Over that time, stony corals split into two main groups with more than 1500 species. But corals are not alone; the use of molecular tools identified symbiosis on microscopic scale. Inside each coral polyp are communities of dinoflagellates, bacteria, and archaea that are together called the coral microbiome. Coral microbiomes can help or harm stressed corals. This can affect reef decline due to coral disease and mass coral bleaching. It is thought that coral species with more innate immunity genes have less diverse microbiomes. However, this has not yet been tested. This project will test this idea using a cost-effective ?genome skimming? approach to compare coral microbes and immunity genes across 128 coral species. This comparison will suggest how different innate immunity genes shape coral microbiomes. The project will use Karenina, a new statistical method, to test ideas about how immunity changes microbiome dynamics during stress.  Finally, the project will test those predictions in laboratory experiments. These research aims are paired with an education plan that will use project data in undergraduate classes, develop a new online interactive bioinformatics textbook, and produce Reef Scenarios, a learning product that will let high school and undergraduate students simulate reef ecology in engaging classroom exercises.<br/><br/>The ability of scleractinian (?stony?) corals to survive many ecological stressors ? from macroalgal competition to bleaching ? is thought to depend on the outcome of coral x microbe x environment interactions. Therefore, understanding how corals regulate their microbiome is important for understanding coral?s response to environmental stress. Coral innate immunity is thought to play a critical role in regulating the microbiome. Yet the relationship between coral innate immunity and microbiome richness, composition, and stability is not yet well understood. This project implements an integrated research and education plan to study how the evolution of cnidarian innate immunity has influenced microbiome structure, and how changes in the bacterial and archaeal portion of the microbiome may influence survival of thermal stress. This approach will combine a global cross-species survey relating innate immune gene repertoires in diverse coral genomes with their microbiome richness and composition and laboratory experiments in a model cnidarian that can confirm or falsify proposed immunity-microbiome interactions from the survey. A new modeling approach will be used to carefully distinguish competing time-series models of the effects of innate immunity and thermal stress on microbiome dynamics. By uniting sequencing approaches with a tractable cnidarian model system, this project will test key hypotheses in cnidarian host-microbe symbiosis, ecology and evolution.  These research objectives are integrated with an education and outreach plan that includes use of project data in undergraduate classes, development of a new interactive online bioinformatics text, and production of Reef Scenarios, a classroom product for simulating reef ecology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because new streams and rivers are rare, little is known about how they form. One place we can learn about this process is within volcanic landscapes. After catastrophic volcanic eruptions, water from springs and snowmelt carve fresh stream channels. The trees that line the newly formed rivers and streams then provide shade, shelter, and crucial inputs of leaves and nutrients into these aquatic systems. These trees also help shape the rivers themselves by stabilizing banks, creating meanders, and slowing erosion.

This research uses plainfin midshipman fish to understand how hormones affect hearing. During the breeding season, male midshipman fish sing to attract mates, making acoustic communication vital for reproductive success. Female midshipman fish show seasonal, estrogen-dependent changes in hearing that make it easier for them to locate potential mates. This research asks how estrogen affects the production, survival, and function of sensory receptors involved in hearing to increase hearing sensitivity. This research has broader impact by increasing understanding of the natural world and providing insight into how hormones can influence the inner ear to modulate hearing ? findings that can apply to many species, including humans. This research also impacts society by exposing high school teachers and their students to both the scientific method and cutting-edge scientific techniques. As part of the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust Partners in Science program, high school teachers will work in university laboratories for two summers, gain valuable research skills, and present their work at national conferences. These teachers also work with the academic team to develop research-based lesson plans for the classroom. Members of the public can learn about this research through interactive museum demonstrations hosted by graduate students. In this way, non-scientists share the excitement of the science and students gain critical communication skills that they can use in the future.<br/><br/>Hormonal modulation of sensory plasticity related to reproductive cycles is widespread among vertebrates, but the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for these steroid-dependent changes remain poorly understood. This project takes an integrated molecular, anatomical, and physiological approach to determine the effects of gonadal steroids on the adaptive auditory plasticity for encoding socially relevant acoustic signals. The objective of this study is to determine how estrogen regulates cellular and molecular changes in the inner ear of the female plainfin midshipman, leading to seasonal, steroid-dependent changes in hearing that enhance intraspecific acoustic communication to facilitate reproduction. The central hypothesis is that estrogen upregulates inner ear gene networks for progenitor cell proliferation, hair cell differentiation, and cell survival, leading to increased hair cell addition and enhanced auditory sensitivity in reproductive female midshipman fish. The experiments use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to manipulate cellular signaling (Wnt, notch, and heat shock signaling pathways) in female midshipman from different reproductive states.

This research uses plainfin midshipman fish to understand how hormones affect hearing. During the breeding season, male midshipman fish sing to attract mates, making acoustic communication vital for reproductive success. Female midshipman fish show seasonal, estrogen-dependent changes in hearing that make it easier for them to locate potential mates. This research asks how estrogen affects the production, survival, and function of sensory receptors involved in hearing to increase hearing sensitivity. This research has broader impact by increasing understanding of the natural world and providing insight into how hormones can influence the inner ear to modulate hearing ? findings that can apply to many species, including humans. This research also impacts society by exposing high school teachers and their students to both the scientific method and cutting-edge scientific techniques. As part of the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust Partners in Science program, high school teachers will work in university laboratories for two summers, gain valuable research skills, and present their work at national conferences. These teachers also work with the academic team to develop research-based lesson plans for the classroom. Members of the public can learn about this research through interactive museum demonstrations hosted by graduate students. In this way, non-scientists share the excitement of the science and students gain critical communication skills that they can use in the future.<br/><br/>Hormonal modulation of sensory plasticity related to reproductive cycles is widespread among vertebrates, but the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms responsible for these steroid-dependent changes remain poorly understood. This project takes an integrated molecular, anatomical, and physiological approach to determine the effects of gonadal steroids on the adaptive auditory plasticity for encoding socially relevant acoustic signals. The objective of this study is to determine how estrogen regulates cellular and molecular changes in the inner ear of the female plainfin midshipman, leading to seasonal, steroid-dependent changes in hearing that enhance intraspecific acoustic communication to facilitate reproduction. The central hypothesis is that estrogen upregulates inner ear gene networks for progenitor cell proliferation, hair cell differentiation, and cell survival, leading to increased hair cell addition and enhanced auditory sensitivity in reproductive female midshipman fish. The experiments use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to manipulate cellular signaling (Wnt, notch, and heat shock signaling pathways) in female midshipman from different reproductive states. Changes in gene expression are assessed with qRT-PCR, cell proliferation and survival with cell biology assays and fluorescent microscopy, and auditory function with electrophysiology. These studies allow to gain insight into neural and endocrine mechanisms that may act to enhance communication in all vertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Laboratory-based efforts to identify genetic and molecular mechanisms of speciation in nematode worms will be aided by the isolation of new worm strains and species by members of the general public. High school students will participate directly in scientific research by collecting nematodes from rotting fruits and flowers. They will learn how research is performed and will also gain a basic understanding of genes, DNA, and evolution that is becoming increasingly more important and societally relevant. By engaging students in the practice of science, this project fulfills one of the three central dimensions in the Next Generation Science Standards recently adopted by many states across the nation and will improve scientific literacy in the general population by helping to build an informed public that understands the scientific enterprise and can better contribute to future national policy decisions that require the interpretation and evaluation of scientific data.<br/><br/>The process of speciation involves the evolution of reproductive barriers between populations within a species so that a single species can split. Though multiple reproductive barriers typically isolate existing species, less is known about which barriers drove the speciation process originally. The goal of the project is to identify genes that cause reproductive isolation and determine their molecular mechanisms of action. The project is focused on identifying genes that mediate incompatibility within species and will operate at three levels to: 1) determine the detailed molecular and cellular mechanism of action of a previously identified intraspecific incompatibility in the nematode C. elegans mediated by a selfish toxin/antidote gene pair, 2) identify the genes involved in a newly discovered nuclear-cytoplasmic intraspecific incompatibility in the related nematode species C. nouraguensis, and 3) systematically search for more intraspecific genetic incompatibilities within the Caenorhabditis genus in a large-scale project to isolate new strains of Caenorhabditis species using a crowdsourcing approach implemented in high school classrooms, and by systematic crosses of strains performed by undergraduate researchers to test for hybrid breakdown."

For example, a human hand, a bat's wing, and a whale's flipper all arise from a common set of instructions that direct the activities of highly conserved molecules that regulate cellular structure, signaling, and adhesion.  Although these processes that give tissues and organs their shape are essential to multicellular life, surprisingly little is known about the underlying mechanisms that regulate the shapes of tissues. This project investigates the physical forces, cellular behaviors, and molecular regulators that determine tissue shape by exploring the formation of eggshell appendages in Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) and related Dipteran (fly) species.  This work develops a novel technique to measure cellular forces and generates new genomic and gene expression data from across a variety of unexplored species.  Additionally, this project brings teachers and students into the laboratory to carry out independent research projects, learn firsthand about the logic and methods of science, and develop STEM lesson plans related to the mechanisms underlying, and evolution of tissue shape.<br/><br/>Epithelial tubes are important features of multi-cellular life and form the framework controlling the shape of many internal organs. While the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tube formation are heavily studied, the mechanisms controlling tube morphology are less well understood. This project uses the dorsal appendages (DAs) of the Drosophila eggshell as a system in which to study the control of tube shape. The DA system is an ideal system in which to address questions of tube formation both because the fundamental mechanisms underlying patterning and the initiation of tube formation have already been heavily studied, and because eggshell appendages vary considerably in shape from one Drosophilid species to another allowing comparative approaches. Within the context of DA formation, the investigators measure the pattern of physical forces exerted by follicle cells on the extracellular matrix, and test whether these forces at the basal surface predict the extent of tube elongation and overall tube geometry. The role of apical cell-shape changes on tube morphology, are also being examined with a special focus on the roles of the motor protein, myosin and the polarity protein, Par3 (Bazooka in flies). Finally, the group is profiling transcriptional differences between species with unique appendage morphologies, with the aim of identifying the molecular changes that facilitated the evolution of shape.  This work reveals and describes the forces that drive changes in organ shape and tissue morphogenesis. Furthermore the project provides hands-on opportunities for teachers and students to be involved in basic research in genetics, biomechanics and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
