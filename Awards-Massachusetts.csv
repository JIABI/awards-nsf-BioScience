"1942176","CAREER: Frontal cortical ensemble regulation of response execution and inhibition","IOS","Modulation","02/01/2020","01/10/2020","David Moorman","MA","University of Massachusetts Amherst","Continuing Grant","Edda Thiels","01/31/2025","$782,080.00","","moorman@umass.edu","Research Administration Building","Hadley","MA","010359450","4135450698","BIO","7714","1045, 1096, 1228, 9178, 9179","$0.00","This project has two main goals.  The first goal is to understand how the brain plans and executes actions as well as how it inhibits actions when they are inappropriate (for example, resisting the urge to take a cookie when watching your sugar intake).  The second goal is to characterize the function of a brain region that has been largely neglected in neuroscience research ? the frontal polar cortex.  This area has been studied in humans and other primates to some degree but is still largely mysterious and has received little attention in rodents, where thorough biological studies can be performed.  What is known in the rodent hints that it may play a key role in the action execution/inhibition process, thus merging an important research question with a relevant, but unexplored brain structure.  These studies use cutting-edge new techniques to provide a highly precise and quantitative characterization of how brain networks regulate action control, and they use a new behavioral framework that permits close association of behavior with brain function.  They also incorporate direct interaction with the general public and support for diverse research populations to strengthen ties between this research to the broader community.  Understanding how brain circuits regulate action is relevant for multiple disciplines, including psychology and neuroscience as well as artificial intelligence and computation.  This understanding may also inform research involving diseases characterized by disrupted action control such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, addictions, eating disorders, diabetes, cancers, and more.  <br/><br/>The prefrontal cortex is repeatedly identified as a critical brain structure regulating action decisions.  The frontal polar cortex, at the rostral end of the prefrontal cortex, has received little research attention to date, particularly in rodents.  Intriguingly, early lesion and stimulation studies in rats demonstrated a role for frontal polar cortex in inhibiting behavioral responses.  Since then, only a few studies have followed this line of research.  The research of this project characterizes the role of frontal pole neuron ensembles in decisions to execute or inhibit behavior and will begin to develop a comprehensive understanding of the role of this brain area in behavior.  An additional goal of this proposal is to study ensembles of neurons to understand what sculpts ensemble-level response properties in similar or different behavioral contexts. Some potential defining elements to be explored include anatomical location of neurons, correlated activity among member neurons, common neuronal projection targets, and other factors.  The project uses novel behavioral tasks, high-density electrophysiological recording (Objective 1), new optogenetic tools for manipulating (Objective 2), and anatomically tracing (Objective 3) neuron ensembles related to action control in an under-characterized brain system.  Activities in Objective 4 are designed to increase awareness of and participation in science, particularly among members of underrepresented communities, in part through a focus on decision-making and its role across fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data collected by the US network of weather radars and new analysis methods let us track these migrations. The Dark Ecology Project will develop new resources allowing us to estimate the densities of migrating birds as they have changed in the last 25 years. One outcome will be our better ability to monitor bird populations and their migration systems, and the impacts of various environmental factors. The US network of weather radars has recorded a comprehensive 20-year archive of images of the atmosphere, which provides the baseline information about bird movements. Extracting biological information from the images is not automated currently, making it very slow and inefficient. A team of ecologists and computer scientists will conduct novel research combining methods in computer vision and machine learning to unlock detailed information about bird migration from the entire US archive of weather radar data. The resulting dataset will be freely available, providing an information resource for researchers to estimate the number of birds migrating on any given night, measure the patterns and trends of bird populations, and do hypothesis driven science. The research will advance big data analysis and visualization techniques for large-scale science questions, and will engage scientists, conservation planners, students, and the general public with data, visualizations, and educational material about bird migration.<br/><br/>Dark Ecology will leverage large-scale cloud computing and develop novel computer vision, machine learning, and radar analysis methods to measure the densities and velocities of migrating birds across the US. Deep convolutional networks will be trained to discriminate migrating birds from precipitation and other clutter in the radar data. New techniques for domain transfer and weakly supervised training will enable the training of convolutional networks with only modest-sized training sets. Gaussian process (GP) models will be developed to create smooth national maps of migration density and velocity. Novel GP methods and cloud-computing workflows will allow us to scale to massive radar data sets and analyze the more then 200 million archived radar scans. The resulting data and tools will be curated with open access policies, and used by the research team to conduct ecological research about patterns and drivers of continent-scale migration.

Although the BDD can appear superficially to be wasteland with little variety, in fact it harbors many unique species, comprise the most endangered set of habitats in Brazil, and is being rapidly being lost to agriculture and other human encroachment. This research will be the first to synthesize information from species' traits, communities, and genetics to understand how the unique traits and communities of organisms living in the BDD evolved. Using a diverse set of approaches to study in detail a variety of animals, plants and fungi that today inhabit this broad swath of dry habitats in central Brazil, the researchers will evaluate: 1) what sorts of traits - such as body size, shape or specific behaviors - allow a group of organisms to succeed in a novel environment? 2) how the novel environment determines the set of organisms - the community - that we see today? 3) how organisms adapt genetically and morphologically to that novel environment? and 4) how novel traits, communities, and genetic changes interact to produce the variety of organisms that are seen in different environments today? Answers to these questions will improve scientists' ability to predict the impacts of a changing world on biodiversity. The project will foster new international research collaborations by engaging a large team of experts from the United States and Brazil and will also provide interdisciplinary research training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.   <br/><br/>To accomplish the four aims listed above, the project will first use a machine learning approach applied to hundreds of traits and lineages in the BDD to determine which traits predict evolutionary success - the tendency for xeric-adapted species to undergo evolutionary diversification. The project will then employ community phylogenetics approaches to understand how functional trait variation is distributed in the BDD, and will determine the evolutionary patterns and over- or under-dispersion of trait values observed in particular communities inhabiting the BDD today, as well as how traits are filtered across habitat gradients. Finally, the project uses a variety of genomic technologies, including whole genome sequencing and transcriptomics, to understand how organisms adapt to the more xeric habitats of the BDD as compared to close relatives living in adjacent mesic biomes. By linking evolutionary patterns in traits, communities and genes, the project will synthesize the functional, phylogenetic and genetic dimensions of biodiversity of the BDD and present a comprehensive portrait of its origins and evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central problem in understanding the origin of the human brain concerns the role of social life and the demands it places on the brain to generate adaptive behavior.  As humans evolved complex societies, it is thought that the brain increased in volume to enable advanced cognition.  Social insects are outstanding models to examine brain evolution in light of social complexity.  This research project employs ants as an ideal model system to analyze the relationship between sociality and brain evolution because different species form colonies that vary in size and the degree of complexity.  This research will also help us understand how exceptionally small brains are able to process complex social information.  The project will analyze differences in the size and organization of worker brains, and their metabolic costs to determine if complex social life has increased the efficiency of energy use in the brain.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate who will become skilled in designing scientific studies and will acquire techniques that enable brains to be imaged.  Students will also learn data analysis, and scientific writing and publication. The researchers will develop a curriculum to enrich the education of K-12 students by introducing them to the study of behavior and neuroscience.  The researchers will recruit diverse participants from the Laboratory Schools of the University of Chicago to encourage minority students to become activity engaged in science. The project will broadly support science outreach in the Chicago STEM Pipeline, Arizona Assurance, Brain Awareness, and Boston Upward Bound programs to address the critical national need to improve science education and train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>To determine how social complexity has influenced brain evolution, the researchers will quantify neuronal metabolic requirements, neuropil investment and scaling, behavioral plasticity, and synaptic organization in brain regions considered key to cognitive function.  Pairs of species representative of major ant subfamilies that accentuate variability in social complexity will form the sample groups.  The researchers will: 1) quantify energetic requirements of functionally specialized neuropil using cytochrome oxidase staining to assess ATP use; 2) determine if brain development is experience-dependent; 3) quantify synaptic complexes associated with cognition; and 4) couple behavioral performance with neural and metabolic metrics.  The researchers will determine neuron number and size and variation in peripheral sensory structures, and examine brain compartment scaling patterns.  Controlling for phylogeny, analyses infer how independent evolutionary events associated with collective intelligence shaped brain evolution. All original images will be freely available upon publication, in the absence of copyright issues.  Organismal data (specimen and colony collection data, phenotypic data, etc.) will be maintained in individual labs, and will be made freely available upon request.

Laboratory and theoretical research has shown that phenotypic plasticity may play an important role in shaping the evolutionary trajectory of species, although the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. This project will lead to a better understanding of the molecular and physiological basis of phenotypic plasticity by comparing two strains of caterpillars that differ in their response to temperature: one strain remains black at all temperatures and another turns green at higher temperatures. Black caterpillars have lower levels of juvenile hormone than green caterpillars, and the project will elucidate the regulation of this important hormone that controls insect growth and development. Determining the molecular and physiological basis of phenotypic plasticity has important implications for our understanding of environmentally-induced diseases, generation of novel traits, and species conservation. Much of the proposed study will involve female undergraduate researchers from Wellesley College who will be exposed to research in integrative biology. These students will be encouraged to present at national meetings and publish their contribution in peer-reviewed journals. The award will support inquiry-based learning in the classroom, and will also expose undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented groups to scientific research.<br/><br/>The specific goal of the proposed study is to determine the genetic mechanism underlying the evolution of an artificially selected polyphenism. In this study, the transcriptomes of the neuroendocrine complex in a monophenic strain of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, and the polyphenic strain will be compared, as these strains differ in the temperature sensitivity of juvenile hormone production. Once candidate temperature-sensitive genes are identified, the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum and RNA interference techniques will be used to functionally characterize these genes. The project will uncover the genetic basis of genetic accommodation and identify the molecular nature of hidden genetic variation, which remains poorly understood. It will lead to a mechanistic understanding of genotype-phenotype-environment interactions and advance understanding of molecular and physiological control of juvenile hormone production. Determining the molecular nature of genetic accommodation and phenotypic plasticity has implications for our understanding of evolution. The findings may also help identify novel regulators of juvenile hormone that could serve as potential targets for pest management. By involving high school and college students in the research and integrating teaching with research, the project also contributes to training the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. This research will examine how specialized proteins from organisms like water bears help them survive extreme conditions with the long-term goal of developing products to stabilize a diversity of biological materials. Learning how these proteins function will allow us to stabilize delicate biological systems such as protein-based drugs, probiotics, and even cell therapies to be deployed in remote environments. Previous work indicates that a class of intrinsically disordered proteins is important in surviving extreme conditions. It has been shown that transplanting one of these proteins from water bears to bacteria can significantly improve its dry resistance. Developing this technology further could lead to dry stable storage of live bacteria that can survive extreme conditions including freeze drying, storage, and distribution which could significantly increase the availability of live probiotic drugs, and biosensors to remote areas of the world. The project will also encourage student-centered research and educational practices through a globally diverse non-profit organization devoted to the discipline of synthetic biology. <br/> <br/>The underlying hypothesis for this work is that this class of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) is protective against extreme conditions such as desiccation, freeze drying, and radiation. This hypothesis will be tested by first identifying proteins that are likely protective by examining expression and experimental data to identify proteins that may confer such protective capabilities. Next, these proteins will be tested for protective capabilities in a variety of scenarios. These include the in-vitro protection of enzyme activity for enzymes like Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) against heat denaturation, and the in-vivo ability to slow pathogenic processes such as immune activation and cell death in human tissue culture. Protein designs that successfully mitigate damage will be studied further to identify key properties that can be accentuated for further protective capacity. These designs will be the basis of products that can protect delicate biological structures from damage. Through this work, the Fellow will gain in depth research experience with synthetic biology with the long-term goal of running his own industrial or academic lab as well as developing teaching and mentoring skills using the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) as a hub for these activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These tubes are composed of cells that squeeze and relax to move contents through the tubes in the correct direction, at the correct rate, and in a coordinated manner. The squeezing is driven by a molecular machine called the acto-myosin cytoskeleton, which is comprised of tiny motors that pull on a girdle-like mesh of fibers to contract the cells. The ""girdle"" must be lined up properly and coordinated between cells for tubes to work properly. However, little is known about how this ""girdle"" knows how to squeeze the right amount at the right time or how its fiber alignment changes in response to changing mechanical conditions. To better understand how this process works, the Cram and Zaidel-Bar labs study the reproductive system of a small nematode worm called C. elegans. This worm can produce its body weight in babies every day, so many eggs have to be squeezed through the reproductive system in a coordinated and robust manner. This system was chosen because the worm is transparent, which makes it easy to see the response of the ""girdle"" in real time in a living animal, and the system uses the same cellular components as do other animals. This project will determine, molecularly, how the worm's acto-myosin ""girdle"" responds to the stretch of eggs entering and exiting the system, and how it contracts just the right amount to push the eggs through in the right direction and without mangling them. Because similar genes regulate acto-myosin contraction in many animals, the results should be broadly applicable up to and including primates. Broader impacts of this project include developing materials to help undergraduates learn how to be scientists, and involving high school teachers in research experiences and helping them design projects that they can take back to their classrooms.<br/><br/>Actin networks in contractile cells, such as the smooth muscle and endothelial cells of the vasculature, are critical for cell contractility, motility, and tissue function. But, how do cells organize their actin cytoskeletons in response to changing mechanical conditions? And how is cytoskeletal alignment coordinated between cells to produce a cohesive tissue-level response? To address these questions, the Cram and Zaidel-Bar labs have developed a new in vivo model system: the C. elegans spermatheca, a stretch-responsive and contractile tissue in the nematode reproductive system. The Cram lab has discovered that during the first ovulation, myosin becomes activated and pulls a network of loose actin fibers into aligned and oriented stress-fiber like acto-myosin bundles. In a screen through all actin binding proteins in C. elegans, the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins Merlin (NFM-1) and Ezrin (ERM-1) were identified as key tissue-level regulators of actin fiber orientation. ERM proteins can bind plasma membrane, actin, and transmembrane proteins, placing them ideally to regulate cell responses to stretch. Using live imaging, biochemical, genetic, and optogenetic approaches, this collaborative team will elucidate the role ERM proteins play in actin organization within and between cells of the spermatheca. Aim 1 will determine the dynamics of the ERM proteins during spermathecal stretch and contraction and discover the mechanism by which these proteins regulate the apical and basal actin networks and tissue-level organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Aim 2 will determine how ERM proteins both regulate and are regulated by the small GTPase Rho, including analysis of a novel regulator C45G9.7/Tip1, to promote cytoskeletal organization and orientation. This project will reveal that Merlin and Ezrin, important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, act not only within individual cells, but in tissue-level coordination of actin cytoskeletal alignment. Novel roles for ERM proteins in cell response to physiological levels of strain will be revealed, including, how the cytoskeleton adapts its orientation and alignment for optimal tissue contractility. The Broader Impacts of this project include 1) developing a structured mentoring approach for undergraduate research and 2) involving science teachers in independent research with the goal of enhancing K-12 STEM education.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first step of gene expression, called transcription, is mediated by a molecular machine called RNA polymerase (RNAP) and is guided by a plethora of proteins collectively named transcription factors. While the study of the bacterial RNAPs continues to provide a framework for understanding transcription in all domains of life, an in depth understanding of RNAP and transcription factor interactions is lacking. In this research, undergraduate student-scientists will use classical and innovative molecular biology techniques to discover and characterize how transcription factors influence RNAP activity in the bacterium E. coli. The findings will lead to a greater understanding of the fundamental principles governing gene expression in all cells and the experimental tools developed will facilitate future studies of protein-protein interactions. Student-scientists will be mentored in all aspects of the research process. In addition, the investigators will develop a CURE (Classroom Undergraduate Research Experience) based on transcription factor-RNAP interactions to teach fifty undergraduates during the funding period, and many more afterwards, about the fundamental topic of protein-protein interactions. The project will also develop a research module for inclusion in a well-established science education outreach program for high school girls that will contribute to their preparedness for future STEM career paths and leadership roles in the sciences. <br/><br/>For the great majority of the 250 transcription factors in E. coli, it remains to be discovered how they influence gene expression and if they make a direct protein-protein contact with RNAP or its seven sigma factors. In this project, the investigators will discover and characterize transcription factor-RNAP domain interactions and transcription factor-sigma domain interactions. Guided by the availability of RNAP crystal structures the investigators have inputted 47 structured domains from RNAP and its sigma factors into a bacterial two-hybrid (B2H) assay. Over 100 previously-identified candidate RNAP-associated proteins will be tested individually for interaction against each RNAP and sigma factor domain. Further, the RNAP and sigma factor domains will be screened against an E. coli proteome library using a B2H assay strain that is optimized for a fluorescence-activated cell sorting protocol enabling the isolation of cells containing productive protein-protein interactions. The investigators will use next generation sequencing to identify the DNA corresponding to the interacting protein-protein pairs. Following the creation of a landscape map of RNAP- and sigma factor-associated proteins, they will characterize exemplary interactions by identifying amino acid substitution(s) in both the transcription factor and the RNAP domain that disrupt the interaction. These genetic tools will be used to learn more about RNAP function by investigating the effect of the transcription factor-RNAP domain interaction on known phenotypes for the transcription factor in vivo, as well as on the initiation, elongation and termination properties of RNAP during transcription in vitro."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Insects can be thought of as tiny pumping machines, circulating hemolymph (insect blood) through active mechanisms (pulsing hearts) and passive elements (wings). Little is known about how insects create an internal circulatory flow. However, the efficiency and delivery of blood throughout the insect is critical for locomotion, immune functions, oxygen delivery and waste management. This research informs basic, yet less-studied functions of insect physiology. By understanding a complex system of circulation, this knowledge is also applicable to several fields.  For agriculture use, this research can quantify how quickly pesticides reach important organs in insects. For biomedical and microfluidic uses, this research can apply insect circulatory flow principles to make efficient devices. This award equips the fellow with advanced training in engineering and hands-on teaching and lesson plan development. The fellow, trained in field biology and insect biomechanics will utilize their training to bring active-learning lessons to classrooms of underrepresented high school students and college students at Virginia Tech.<br/><br/>Continuous flow of hemolymph within insect bodies and wings ensure that living tissue, sensory structures remain functional. This research investigates how the integration of active (pulsing insect hearts) and passive (structural features, wing venation) influences the efficacy of the insect circulatory system and how these components influence overall internal flow.  The fellow will use the North American grasshopper (Schistocerca americana), the darkling beetle (Zophobas morio), and the European honeybee (Apis mellifera). These species are widely-studied and span a broad size range. First, the fellow will quantify hemolymph velocity within the wing circulatory network. Using x-ray visualization at the Advanced Photon Source to visualize blood movement and fiber optic pressure sensors to measure fluid pressures during active heart pumping, the fellow will describe internal flow movement. Secondly, to understand hemolymph?s biophysical properties and interactions with soft pumps (insect hearts) and rigid walls (exoskeleton), this fellow will partner with researchers at Clemson University to build a micro-rheology system at Virginia Tech, that determines hemolymph viscosity. Lastly, in order to package this information for future use in insect physiology, agriculture and biomedical device design, the fellow will create 3D mathematical models of the insect fluidic system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study the domestication of fungi. Because of underlying differences in population biology, ecology, and artificial selection by humans for desired traits, the researchers hypothesize that the effect of domestication on fungi is distinct from plant and animal domestication. The researchers have recently developed Aspergillus oryzae as a model of fungal domestication. This species is a filamentous mold used for millennia in the production of traditional fermented Asian foods and beverages. In using these fungi as part of food processing and production, humans have changed the traits and DNA blueprint of these fungal species. This project will explore those changes. This research has the potential to improve the safety of food fermentation and to shed light on the health benefits of fermented foods. Importantly, this project will involve the public in scientific discovery through a citizen-science project. Members of the public will be encouraged to contribute samples of homemade or commercial fermented foods. Undergraduates, through direct research experiences or through hands-on coursework, will isolate and identify microorganisms from food samples. Students will gain practical experience in microbiology, molecular biology, genomics and bioinformatics. The results of this project will be adapted into a film in partnership with faculty and undergraduate students in the arts.<br/><br/>In parallel with the domestication of plants and animals, fungi (e.g. yeasts and molds) were also domesticated for their utility in food preservation, flavoring, aroma, and texture. However, it remains largely unexplored whether the generalizations formed through the study of domesticated plants and animals can be extended to domesticated fungi. To address whether the patterns and effects of domestication are similar between fungi and across plants, animals, and fungi, the researchers will analyze patterns of genomic and phenotypic variation across hundreds of isolates of A. oryzae and its progenitor A. flavus, and compare these results to two existing models of fungal domestication (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Penicillium roqueforti). It will identify the genomic regions that were targeted by artificial selection and determine the phenotypic effect of domestication on A. oyzae. The project will measure growth rate, inhibitory effects on community food microbes, volatile compound profiles, and gene expression profiles of A. oryzae and A. flavus strains under diverse conditions. The outcomes of this research will shed light on the process of domestication and its effect on fungi and will increase our knowledge of the genomic and evolutionary processes underlying adaptation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Determining how plants successfully reproduce requires understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying how female reproductive organs (pistils) recognize and accept high quality pollen while rejecting low quality pollen. The recognition between pistils and pollen is significant for two important mate choices in plants - distinguishing between self-pollen and non-self-pollen as well as between pollen from the same species and pollen from different species. This research investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying self-pollen reject and foreign-species pollen rejection in Phlox drummondii, a native Texas wildflower. In this species there is extensive natural variation in the ability of pistils to recognize and reject self and foreign pollen and the variation in these two recognition systems is highly correlated across individuals. This research involves a detailed genetic investigation of molecular mechanisms causing pollen-pistil recognition and the causes of the correlation between incompatibilities. Specifically, this research combines quantitative genetic dissection of variation in incompatibilities, with genome-wide gene expression analyses, and an artificial selection experiment to discover new mechanisms of pollen-pistil interactions in a species that has evolved self and foreign incompatibly independently of those found in model plant systems. This research will be complemented by outreach activities associated with the local natural history museum. The scientists will create educational activities for elementary and high school students, provide teacher professional development workshops about floral diversity, and organize public lectures on plant science. <br/><br/>This project investigates the long-standing hypothesis that self and heterospecific pollen-pistil incompatibility systems are mechanistically linked by dissecting the molecular basis of variation in incompatibility within a non-model wildflower species. Specifically, this research will determine if self and heterospecific recognition share genetic mechanisms, if the breakdown of self and heterospecific incompatibility involves multiple genes including genes outside the self-identity locus, and if the correlation between self and heterospecific incompatibility could constrain the evolution of pollen-pistil recognition. To accomplish these goals, this research will determine the molecular mechanisms underlying incompatibly through whole-genome gene expression analyses, characterize the genetic architecture of the breakdown of self and heterospecific pollen recognition through genetic mapping experiments, and quantify the genetic constraint imposed by the correlation between incompatibilities using an artificial selection experiment. This integrative research will test specific hypotheses about the genetic basis of incompatibly in plants while discovering new mechanisms of pollen-pistil recognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The low-oxygen conditions in these water bodies favors production of methane ? a potent greenhouse gas that is twenty-five times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Although these water bodies are widespread and can persist for decades, we know little about the factors controlling methane production in reservoirs, or their collective contribution to the global carbon budget. This OPUS award addresses that knowledge gap by supporting new research, relevant training, and mentorship opportunities for the principal investigator. Exposure to cutting-edge lab techniques will allow her to examine the mechanisms underlying methane production in reservoirs and expand the scope of her future research. Resulting datasets will be useful for scientists modeling the global carbon cycle, as well as national agencies tasked with monitoring sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. They also have practical applications for the management of reservoirs in Brazil and other tropical regions. Ultimately, results will improve understanding of which pathways dominate methane fluxes and help identify potential management strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in agricultural landscapes.<br/><br/>By facilitating the synthesis of data collected with this award with datasets from over a decade of research in the southeastern Amazon, this project will address several key research objectives. First, it will help clarify the pathways of methane production and consumption through analyses of stable isotopes (13C, D) and the dynamics of sediment accumulation and organic carbon burial in reservoirs. Second, it will shed light on the relative importance of different sources of organic matter driving microbial methane production using a combination of radiocarbon (14C) and stable isotope analyses. Carbon isotopes in sediments may also yield insights into the relative importance of external sources of organic matter (i.e. carbon derived from forest, pasture grasses, or soybeans) versus internal production (i.e. algae or macrophytes stimulated by recent nutrient deposition). Lastly, this work will inform global modeling efforts by characterizing the isotopic fingerprint of biogenic reservoir emissions in the atmosphere and evaluating their relative importance as a methane source. Ultimately, carbon isotopes may provide important clues about whether reservoirs act as a global source or sink of carbon in the landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants need to regulate these processes to minimize wasteful expenditures of resources. This project will investigate how plants respond quickly and precisely to attack by using the production of a class of defense-related compounds (called alkaloids) from the Catharanthus roseus plant (commonly known as the Madagascar periwinkle) as an example.  Under normal conditions, growth is promoted while the production of alkaloids is low.  But in the presence of pathogens or attackers the plant responds by producing chemical signals (such as the plant hormone jasmonic acid) which rapidly activates the communication system that leads to the production of these defense-related alkaloids.  This project seeks to determine how the plant coordinately regulates growth, development, and defense through a class of regulatory switches, known as the zinc finger transcription factors. This research will involve the interdisciplinary mentoring and advising of graduate students and undergraduates, and the outreach to K-12 and under-represented groups through a Research Experience for Teachers and Young Scholars Program.  <br/><br/>In Catharanthus roseus, the mechanism for controlling the rapid defense response is partially mediated through activation of the zinc finger Catharanthus transcription (ZCT) factors leading to the production of terpenoid indole alkaloids.  In addition to terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis, zinc finger transcription factors appear to be involved in other defense and stress-related responses.  In plants, Cys2-His2-type (C2H2) zinc fingers are an important class of transcription factors involved in controlling growth, development, and stress-responsive genes (cold, drought, salt, and oxidative stress) that contain a unique motif involved in gene repression. However, only a limited number of plant C2H2 zinc finger proteins have been studied in detail. Of these, ZCT is unique in that it is the only one involved in regulating growth and development and defense-related alkaloid biosynthesis. The goal of this project is to better understand how plants coordinately regulate growth, development, and defense to improve fitness and adaptation. This project seeks to elucidate the regulatory network by which hormone inputs coordinate the outputs of growth, development, and alkaloid biosynthesis through ZCT.  This fundamental knowledge and insight regarding plant control mechanisms is anticipated to lead to improved resistance of crops towards stress and pathogens, to improved production of defense-related compounds that have medicinal value, and to artificial genetic circuits for enabling rapid regulation of a desired output. The aims for this project are to 1) elucidate the regulatory circuit by which ZCT's role in defense is activated through the hormone jasmonic acid; 2) elucidate the regulatory circuit by which ZCT's role in growth and development is activated through the hormone gibberellic acid; and 3) characterize how ZCT mediates growth, development, and defense-related alkaloid biosynthesis.<br/><br/>This project is supported jointly by programs in Systems and Synthetic Biology (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering (Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems)."

To ensure that each daughter cell receives a complete set of the instructions for life, cells first duplicate their genetic material (DNA) and then move one copy to each daughter cell.  Cells perform this task millions of times each day. The machine utilized for cell division is called the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is required to organize and arrange the chromosomal DNA and segregate it into the daughter cells. This process is extremely important for the formation, development and maintenance of all living organisms. The self-organization of the mitotic spindle cannot be understood using biology alone. Rather, it requires the understanding of the underlying physical principles that govern the assembly and function of the mitotic spindle. The research conducted here will apply physical concepts behind self-organization of liquid crystals (the same liquid crystals found in computer and cell phone screens) to understand the ability of the mitotic spindle to organize itself in the absence of outside instructions. Understanding the fundamental rules of life that underlie cellular organization will result in new knowledge about how cells work as well as new insights to help us understand and ultimately fight diseases.  The project will involve outreach to 8th and 9th grade girls in the nearby community, along with interdisciplinary training of undergraduates and graduate students.<br/><br/><br/>The scientific objective of this proposal is to understand how microtubule turnover and crosslinking control the organization and dynamics of the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is a high-density organization of cross-linked microtubules which should be enough to stall the inherent microtubule dynamic instability as well as the mobility of the filaments within the structure. Yet, it has been shown that the spindle undergoes overall flux from the chromosomes toward the poles. This flux has been noted to be faster at the chromosomes than at the poles. A new model put forth by the investigators proposes that the flux is an essential process to fluidize the spindle near chromosomes where enhanced motion is needed to error correction. Flux decreases at the poles because of increased adhesion due to higher levels of crosslinkers put there by the process of flux. This exciting new model creates a new physical framework to begin exploring the underlying fundamental principles that enable the dynamic self-organization of the mitotic spindle. The proposed work will directly test the hypothesized model using quantitative light microscopy and genetic manipulations. These tests will reveal new information on the inner workings of the spindle. The proposal directly responds to several important aspects of modern biological research including integrating across scales, from single molecules to complex structures and whole cells. The active matter experiments directly address the synthesis of life-like systems using minimal purified components. From a physics perspective, the synthesis of life-like systems are essential to understanding the non-equilibrium processes of biology that couple to self-organize, sense, and respond to stimuli. This is a frontier area of physics and materials research, which will uncover new knowledge about fundamental cell biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To make modern devices more suitable for use in close proximity to humans and for work in natural environments it is important that we find new ways to build machines that are biologically compatible, biodegradable, environmentally safe and able to interface with tissues. A major challenge for making such biologically compatible machines is that there are no suitable motors (actuators) to make them move. Attempts to use muscle cells derived from animals such as frogs and mice have had limited success because vertebrate tissues require an intricate blood system and they are easily damaged by changing environmental conditions. It is also hard to replicate the conditions found in a vertebrate embryo that make muscles grow appropriately. This research introduces a new biological approach to making such actuators by growing them from insect cells produced during metamorphosis. Adult insect tissues (such as flight muscles) form directly on existing larval tissues and their growth can be controlled using simple manipulations of insect hormones. Preliminary studies show that insect muscles can be grown in culture at room temperature and that they will survive for many months. This research will identify the conditions needed to generate powerful insect muscles and develop methods to grow them for use in living machines. Successful completion of this work will lead to the production of an engineered muscle that can be sustained for several months and that can generate forces ten times greater than current muscle actuators grown in culture. The work will have wider implications in revealing some of the processes (genetic, biochemical and hormonal) that lead to the re-programming of cells that must occur as part of insect metamorphosis. This is expected to stimulate new experimental approaches to studies of tissue specification, growth and repair.<br/> <br/>These studies will test the hypothesis that fully formed tissues can be grown ex-vivo from metamorphic cells of the tobacco hawk moth Manduca sexta. Using the dorsal longitudinal (flight) muscles (DFM) as a target tissue the experiments will focus on four main goals: 1) To characterize the physiological and molecular changes that accompany DFM formation during metamorphosis and in culture. Measurements will be made of in vivo changes in electrical characteristics and the contractile properties using isometric/isotonic tests and dynamic work loops. The gene expression profile (transcriptome) of developing muscles and growing explants will be compared at different stages to help identify gene networks associated with Manduca muscle formation. 2) To characterize the roles of local (cell-cell, mechanical) and systemic (circulating) factors in muscle specification, differentiation and growth. This will involve tissue excision and cross stage transplant methods that are well established for insects. 3) To recapitulate the normal formation of adult dorsal flight muscles from larval precursors in culture by engineering the hormonal and substrate conditions. The transcriptomes of the in-vitro muscles will be compared with both native larval and adult DFMs to look for changes in key developmental and physiological gene networks. 4) To grow and maintain muscle constructs in-vitro for practical actuator applications. The goal is to engineer a muscle that can be sustained for several months and that can generate stress an order of magnitude better than current in-vitro muscle actuators by maximizing survival, cell proliferation and eventual differentiation. It is expected that this process will produce densely packed muscle fibers that can be used for high-stress actuators. The unified contraction of these fibers will be controlled by growing them on micro-electrode arrays or though the expression of light-sensitive channels such as ChR2. This research will engage graduate students in cross-disciplinary research in soft robotics."

Characterizing several critical substeps of the elongation cycle (tRNA accommodation, hybrid-state formation, translocation and domain rotations) will elucidate how the ionic environment shapes the energy landscape of the ribosome. This will help uncover the modes by which ions can enable conformationally-complex biological dynamics. With the high negative charge density of RNA, the dynamics of ribonucleoprotein assemblies rely critically on a locally diffuse ionic environment, which can lead to attraction between negatively charged RNA molecules. Accordingly, to fully characterize the energetics of large-scale biological assemblies, one must properly describe the statistical properties of the ionic environment. To address this challenge, simplified energetic models will be developed that employ all-atom resolution, as well as explicitly represented monovalent and divalent ions. Calibration of the energetic parameters will be established through comparison with experiments and explicit-solvent simulations of prototypical systems. These simplified models will then enable the simulation of large-scale (20-100 Angstroms) conformational transitions in the ribosome.

They have a highly complex system for camouflage, enabling them to blend in with their environment instantaneously. They have an advanced ability for learning and memory. They have large brains (the common octopus has 6 times as many nerve cells as a rat). These and other innovations have evolved along an independent trajectory from the vertebrates, the only other similarly advanced group. By studying cephalopods, much can be learned regarding biological complexity; however, these studies have lagged due to the lack of a suitable cephalopod model system. Over the past 30 years, genetically tractable model organisms like the fruit fly and lab mouse have driven biological discovery. This project aims to develop the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid into the first genetically tractable cephalopod model. This species is ideal because it is small, it can be cultured through its entire lifecycle, and it reaches sexual maturity in as little as two and a half months. The project involves the establishment of a large-scale culture facility at the Marine Biological Laboratory to provide specimens for genetic manipulation. Husbandry methods are perfected to culture these organisms through multiple generations. Finally, techniques for genome editing are developed. All resources developed under this project, including animals and methods for gene knockouts, are shared with the scientific community of cephalopod enthusiasts through workshops. Additional efforts include assistance with the incorporation of cephalopod biology into educational curricula for undergraduate students, and into public outreach activities, such as exhibits at science museums. <br/><br/>As a group, the coleoid cephalopods exhibit extraordinary novelties, many that are poised to promote biological discovery across disciplines. For example, they have by far the largest brains of any invertebrate, and show behavioral sophistication comparable to advanced vertebrates. Through convergence, they have evolved camera-type eyes and the biomechanical capabilities of their appendages inspire robotic design. Conspicuous symbioses with marine microbes make some species ideal models for studying symbioses. Recently sequenced genomes and transcriptomes have uncovered molecular novelties. In octopus, for example, large-scale expansions of cell adhesion molecules may help explain how complex nervous systems are assembled. Other studies indicate that cephalopods use RNA editing at unprecedented levels to diversify genetic information. Taken together, these phenomena underscore the vast potential of cephalopods to broaden our understanding of fundamental and unexplored area in biology; however, the field has struggled to advance without a genetically tractable model. The cephalopod community has lacked a model because the husbandry of these organisms is difficult. This work overcomes a key bottleneck in cephalopod research by developing Euprymna scolopes, the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, into a genetically tractable model. This species is ideal because it is small, it can be cultured through its lifecycle, and it reaches sexual maturity rapidly. To accomplish the project goals, a lifecycle culture facility is established and protocols for genome editing using CRISPR-Cas9 are developed. Animals produced by this facility are offered to the scientific community. Protocols for husbandry and genome editing are disseminated through workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical cues signal the presence of food, mates, predators, and toxic substances, and animals are attracted, repelled, or indifferent to individual odors. However, the responses of animals to chemicals are not fixed, but can be altered by their past experience and current state. For example, prolonged prior exposure to an odor decreases subsequent responses to that chemical, and juveniles and adults can exhibit different responses to chemicals. This flexibility ensures that the animal exhibits the behavior that is most appropriate for its current condition. The overall goal of this project is to explore how an animal's experience and its developmental stage alter the functions of the nervous system to drive different chemical-sensing behaviors. Given the importance of smell and taste in animal lifecycles, this work allows us to begin to explore how changes in the environment may impact animal welfare, and aid in animal husbandry and conservation efforts. The proposed work supports the training of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, and all efforts will be made to involve members of underrepresented minority groups. The project also builds research relationships between university labs and high school students and teachers. The insights from this work are shared with the public via hands-on demonstrations at local science museums and science fairs. The proposed work also incorporates collaborations among biologists, chemists and bioengineers, and is thus expected to promote interdisciplinary learning and innovation.<br/><br/>Both innate and learned behaviors are flexible, and are extensively modulated by an animal's experience as well as its external and internal state. The specific goal of this proposal is to identify and characterize the molecules, neurons, and circuits that mediate context- and developmental stage-specific plasticity in chemosensory behavioral responses of the nematode C. elegans. Preliminary experiments suggest that contextual cues modulate the output of antagonistic neural circuits to toggle the response to a simple alcohol between attraction and aversion. The behavioral strategies and neuronal mechanisms underlying this response flexibility is characterized using high-resolution analyses of behavioral states and neuronal activity under defined conditions. C. elegans chemosensory behaviors are also dramatically modulated as a function of developmental stage and environmental experience. The proposed research characterizes this experience- and stage-dependent chemosensory behavioral plasticity, and identifies the required neuronal and molecular mechanisms. Results from this work provide new information about the mechanisms by which animals efficiently alter their behaviors in response to changing external and internal conditions."

Strong interest in marshes as carbon sinks is likely to spur new programs to offset carbon emissions by restoring degraded wetlands, raising a host of questions concerning whether marsh restorations can successfully rehabilitate other ecosystem functions.  A key ecosystem functions of salt marshes is their ability to remove biologically available nitrogen through a microbial process known as denitrification.  Biologically available nitrogen is entering coastal ecosystems at increasing rates as a result of human activities such as application of fertilizers and combustion of fossil fuels. When this nitrogen makes its way to coastal waters it can result in a host of negative environmental effects associated with eutrophication, including increasing areas of low oxygen water known as coastal dead zones.  The microbes living in salt marshes are able to remove portions of this excess biologically available nitrogen by converting it back to nitrogen gas, suggesting a benefit of salt marsh restoration, however, more information is needed regarding how these microbes may respond to environmental changes associated with restoration.  This study will provide new insight on how restoration of a New England salt marsh will alter the capacity of the marsh to remove biologically available nitrogen and will increase understanding of the physiology of the microbes that underlie this critical biogeochemical pathway through a combination of in situ rate measurements, environmental metagenomics, and whole genome sequencing. <br/><br/>The results of this research will provide important new information to restoration practitioners on the conditions that are mostly likely to successfully restore the denitrification capacity of degraded salt marshes so that they reach parity with undisturbed marshes.  This work will also enhance scientific infrastructure and knowledge transfer through two mechanisms.  First, it will train one early career female scientist, a postdoctoral scholar, and two graduate students.  Second, research on the denitrification capacity of salt marshes will be incorporated into a First Year Seminar for undergraduate students at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the only public university in the city, which serves a large minority and first generation college student population.  This seminar program is designed to increase retention of at risk biology majors by engaging them in research experiences in the early days of their college career. Through collaborations with the Massachusetts Department of Ecological Restoration, the students will meet with stakeholders, design and carry out research in recently restored marshes in the greater Boston area, and report their findings back to the stakeholders. This community-engaged scholarship provides a unique mechanism to disseminate information to stakeholders and it engages students in the scientific process in a way that promotes accountability, generates higher quality outcomes and excites them about the field of ecology."

While all the molecular pathways studied here are present in vertebrate animals including humans, these experiments are conducted in roundworms because they have a compact and defined nervous system, are amenable to genetic manipulation and, in particular, do not have any blood vessels. This makes it possible to avoid confounding effects that changes in vascular development might indirectly have on neural development. Results from this project will advance scientific understanding of nerve cell signaling and plasticity; this research may also identify new genes and molecular pathways important for learning and memory. A complementary outreach plan will develop an instructional research module for use at local public high schools, and a full-semester neurobiology lab course for undergraduates where students have a real opportunity to generate new scientific knowledge that could develop into an independent research project. In the process of performing the proposed research aims, this project will also train graduate students and provide hands-on independent research opportunities for undergraduates, for educators, and for under-represented minorities in a dedicated summer program.<br/><br/>The modulation of synaptic strength via activity-dependent changes in glutamate receptor (GluR) abundance at synapses is a major mechanism underlying learning and memory. While previous work has identified the molecular mechanisms that directly traffic GluRs to and from synapses, less is known about in-vivo secreted factors that act on these receptor trafficking pathways. Preliminary studies from the Principal Investigator?s laboratory have used an optogenetic glutamatergic behavior screen in C. elegans to identify the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR) homologs ver-1 and ver-4, which are activated by the secreted VEGF homolog PVF-1. Data also suggest that VER-1 and VER-4, and the ligand PVF-1, regulate both cell surface levels of the GluR GLR-1 and glutamatergic behaviors in C. elegans. The goal of this proposal is to investigate whether regulated secretion of PVF-1/VEGF activates neuronal VER/VEGFR signaling to modulate GLR-1/GluR recycling to the cell surface, thereby impacting behavior. C. elegans is a particularly suitable organism for these studies because of their lack of vasculature, allowing these experiments on the neural effects of VEGFRs to be free of confounds from the vasculature. This work will elucidate the mechanisms by which VER signaling within neurons regulates GLR-1 trafficking, and how PVF-1 expression or secretion are regulated in vivo to modulate GLR-1 abundance and behavior.

The function of proteins are frequently regulated by a wide-variety of reversible chemical modifications, such as acetylation of lysine residues. While numerous such acetylations have been identified on various human proteins, their role in biology remains unclear. Many human proteins are acetylated at multiple different sites, but how these individual modifications contribute to regulation remains poorly understood. The current inability to generate target proteins homogeneously acetylated at a set of chosen sites is a major challenge. This limitation will be overcome by establishing a novel technology. This technology will allow direct modification of a target protein during its synthesis in human cells. This will enable systematic elucidation of how multi-site acetylation regulates protein function. A cross-disciplinary summer research program will be developed to train and motivate high-school students from the greater Boston area. <br/><br/>In the last two decades, rapid advances in analytical techniques have identified numerous human proteins that are acetylated at multiple sites. However, the daunting challenge of producing recombinant proteins in a homogeneous state of acetylation been a major roadblock. The genetic code expansion technology offers a powerful strategy to overcome this limitation, by allowing co-translational site-specific incorporation of N (epsilon)-acetyllysine (AcK) into recombinant proteins using an engineered nonsense suppressing aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair. However, it is currently challenging to incorporate more than one AcK residue per protein in mammalian cells. To address this limitation, systematic engineering of the components of the mammalian translation system that limit the incorporation efficiency of AcK, will be carried out. A novel directed evolution platform for engineering these components based on their performance in live mammalian cells will be developed. The enhanced AcK-incorporation system will be used to interrogate how the function of HMGCS2 is regulated by the acetylation of three different lysine residues. Outreach efforts include a summer research program targeted to local high school students.

These genes will be modeled as ?agents? in an agent-based modeling approach to distinguish between a ""driver"" hypothesis, with robustness coordinated by a few epigenotypes of large effect, or an alternate ""small-impact"" hypothesis, with robustness arising from many epigenotypes of individually small effect, and between the possibility of few versus many evolutionary paths to a given robustness phenotype.

This challenge is particularly acute for small insects, which include major agricultural pests and animal disease vectors, from aphids and flies to mosquitoes. The body temperatures of these animals closely follow the ambient temperature, and their sensitivity to temperature, especially cold, is a key factor in determining their geographic distributions. In this project, the researchers will probe the molecular and cellular pathways through which animals adjust their physiology to withstand cooling, using the fruit fly Drosophila as a model. The key systems this animal uses to sense that the environmental temperature is dropping will be identified. Next, the researchers will examine how the initial sensation of cooling is communicated to and processed by the brain. Finally, the investigators will examine how signals from the brain act to adjust the animal's physiology so that key organ systems are able to cope with environmental change. From an intellectual perspective, these studies will provide insight into how an animal's senses can modulate its physiology, and into how an animal can respond to environmental challenges. This work is designed with several broader impact objectives. These include training undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral fellows in biological research, providing experiential learning opportunities to engage undergraduate students in scientific research, providing mentored teaching opportunities for graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, and providing publicly available resources for the research and educational communities. <br/><br/>Temperature affects all biological processes, and the ability to sustain physiological function despite fluctuations in body temperature is important for animal survival. In this proposal, the investigators will examine how animals withstand temperature fluctuations, particularly cooling, using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model. The proposal uses a combination of molecular genetics, physiology and behavior to examine three main research goals. First, the cellular and molecular sensors through which cooling is detected to initiate physiological changes that confer cool tolerance will be identified and studied. Second, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in eliciting these physiological changes will be identified and examined. Third,  the extent of inter-species variation and environmental plasticity in cool tolerance among multiple Drosophila species will be explored, identifying promising natural variants and regulatory strategies for further study.  Together, these studies will provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which animals sense temperature and modulate their thermotolerance to cope with fluctuations in environmental temperature."

This training course remains a ""Gold Standard"" for bringing together faculty, and students selected from a highly qualified pool, across many disciplines in the life sciences. The instructors work closely as a cohesive team to educate early-career biologists, many of whom go on to make their own ground-breaking discoveries. The MBL Physiology Course fosters a unique training environment that uses cellular, molecular, and physical principles of biology to understand living organisms. This NSF award will be used to integrate cellular and genomic science with principles and practices of organismal and evolutionary biology. Faculty and students will combine their unique perspectives to problem solving in physiology. By so doing, a deeper understanding of the physiological principles of ""How Life Works"" will be attained and integrated across biological subdisciplines. To extend the learning experience beyond the time that each trainee spends at the MBL, instructors in the MBL Physiology Course will invite and support teams of students to continue to work together after they return to their respective research groups at their home institutions. Through this post-course experience, each participant will have the opportunity to engage and educate the general public regarding fundamental principles of living organisms, related to the societal importance of new knowledge and discovery in the life sciences.  The MBL Physiology Course provides intensive training and research experiences at critical intersections of cell biology and physical science - ranging from molecular biology, genetics, genomics, to evolutionary biology. The course begins with an intensive ""Boot Camp,"" when biologists, physicists, and all students become familiar with cutting-edge techniques in cellular anatomy and physiology, fabrication, bioinformatics, while working together to analyze big data sets. The revised MBL Physiology Course will now incorporate interactions with three other concurrent summer courses to bring physiology ""back into the organism"" and challenge students to consider cells in their natural contexts. Intentionally bringing students together from the Physiology, Microbial Diversity, Embryology, and Biology of Parasites courses will provide opportunities for synergism of ideas and expanded multidisciplinary perspectives inherent in this horizontal integration across biological subdisciplines. The MBL Physiology Course trains a diverse student body, with specific attention given to the recruitment and support of under-represented groups in STEM. In addition, the course will aid students in disseminating techniques and concepts via support of organized groups at the students' home institutions and at scientific conferences.

This is because, during their nearly 4-billion-year history, microbes have ""invented"" numerous metabolic reactions that have transformed the Earth's environment.  To understand these processes, their impacts on the ecosystem, and to harness them for societal benefits requires a multidisciplinary approach.  Microbial Diversity is an advanced research training program at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) that augments traditional PhD and postdoctoral training through an intensive 6.5 week, immersive experience that occurs in the peak summer months when prominent scientists across biological disciplines convene at MBL. This research-training program teaches cutting-edge methods and concepts that impact microbial ecology, ecosystem function and animal-associated microbiomes.  To accomplish these goals, participants will receive broad research training at the forefront of microbiological sciences, research ethics and scientific outreach to the public.  This experience has broad impacts for the following reasons: 1) The transformative nature of the program enhances retention in research and academic positions; 2) Mentoring postdoctoral trainees in curriculum development provides valuable teaching experience; 3) Participants from underrepresented groups in science will contribute towards the diversification of the scientific workforce.   Research products that will emerge from the course include publicly-available resources and cultured isolates of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. Many students from this research-training program go on to be leaders in research that incorporates microbial biodiversity, and in at the intersection of science and society.  <br/> <br/>This research-training experience integrates training across biological scales; from understanding one metabolic pathway in a single organism, to dynamics of single cells in a population, to understanding the impact of microbes on the ecosystem scale.  The goal of this program is to integrate training from the disciplines of microbiology, ecology, evolution, chemistry, computational science, and bioinformatics in order to shape the future leaders of microbial diversity science. This is accomplished by integrating modeling, experimentation, and function with emerging cellular properties across broad spatio-temporal scales in order to be able to predict the behavior of living cells in natural systems. In the next three years, specific training will be offered in: (i) cultivation that leverages information from the vast, publicly-available sequence databases, with a focus on novel eukaryotes, viruses, and microbial consortia, (ii) isolating and characterizing the role of viruses in microbial diversity, function and ecology; (iii) quantitative tools and modeling of high-resolution changes of metabolic fluxes in time and space.  The objectives of this research-training experience are as follows: (i) Participants will receive broad research training in transformative theoretical and applied approaches at the forefront of microbiological sciences, through a combination of classroom, workshop, and laboratory-based didactic activities; (ii) Intensive and ongoing longitudinal explorations of marine, freshwater and host-associated microbial communities will be integrated to identify microbial dynamics over a five-year time series of publicly available data, and (iii) Postdoctoral researchers will receive direct experience in active learning in the classroom and laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding development of these bacterial communities is a topic of wide interest, yet the existing knowledge on this subject, particularly in the aging and disassembly phase of the developmental cycle, is largely lacking. The project focuses on how important environmental and physiological signals influence bacterial social development. Learning about this signaling process will increase basic understanding of bacterial multicellular development and enhance the ability to modify these bacterial communities in practical situations such as agriculture and sustainability. The project will also integrate aspects of research and teaching and will extensively involve training of graduate students and recruitment of undergraduate students motivated to gain hands on research experiences early in their education.

The simultaneous oxidation of proteins is increasingly recognized as an important means of coordinating protein function both within and between cells. Specifically, the oxidation of cysteine residues (an amino acid within proteins) plays an important role in regulating proteins involved in fat metabolism, gene expression, and cell shape. However, little is known about how cysteine oxidation is coordinated between cells because it has been difficult to measure oxidation non-destructively in live organisms. Recent innovations in imaging of cysteine oxidation in living animals enable the researcher to fill this critical gap in knowledge, which currently limits understanding of how multicellular organisms coordinate diverse cellular processes. It is expected that the proposed research will have a wide-reaching impact on aging, metabolism, inflammation, and other fields where physiological processes are influenced by protein oxidation. The project integrates research and education by providing research and learning opportunities on the science of aging for students in grades 6-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and the public. These opportunities include laboratory research experiences and educational leadership development for undergraduates, research modules that engage hundreds of new undergraduates in cutting-edge research experiences, and an open classroom that will outreach to hundreds of senior citizens and establish inter-generational relationships between them and students.<br/><br/>Cysteine oxidation disrupts enzyme catalysis and is an important regulatory mechanism for hundreds of proteins that control a wide variety of cellular processes. Little is known about the intercellular signaling pathways that can affect the oxidation of these proteins in a concerted manner. The objective of this project is to determine how intercellular signaling pathways regulate cytosolic protein oxidation in specific target tissues and with aging, using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a tractable model system. Protein oxidation will be measured with single-cell resolution in live animals, using a genetically-encoded, fluorescent sensor. The research questions addressed are: (1) How do sensory neurons regulate protein oxidation in distant target tissues? (2) How does local intercellular signaling regulate protein oxidation in specific target tissues? (3) How is the trajectory of protein oxidation with aging determined by intercellular signaling? This project will provide research opportunities in the science of aging for elementary to graduate level students, develop new courses and authentic research modules for undergraduate students, and improve public awareness and knowledge about aging science by offering courses designed to engage senior citizens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Describing genetic influences on behavior is particularly challenging if genes in social partners interact to generate behavior. Little is known about the extent of such genetic influences, whether their effects vary across populations or the physiological mechanisms that allow the genes in one individual to influence another individual's behavior. Trinidadian guppies are an excellent model system to study these effects on behavior because guppies perform a suite of cooperative antipredator behavior that is strongly influenced by social partners and which varies greatly across populations depending on predation risk. This project uses statistical genetics to describe the relative importance of an individual's own genes and those of its social partners for generating cooperation among guppies. This project will also link variation in physiology, gene expression, and sensory anatomy to variation in cooperation across populations. Undergraduates from under-represented groups will be provided long-term comprehensive research and mentorship experiences. An active learning curriculum for evolution classes will be developed. This work will advance our scientific understanding of the genetics of complex traits, including social behavior, while preparing diverse students to be scientists, educators, and mentors.<br/><br/>How interacting phenotypes, such as cooperation, evolve depends on both the genetic architecture of the behavior and the structure of the social environment. This project will describe the complete genetic architecture of indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on guppy antipredator behavior, especially as it might vary with changes in social selection imposed by cooperation under differential predation risk. A quantitative genetic breeding design paired with behavioral experiments will measure the influence imposed by and responsiveness to social partners and genetic covariances between those traits for high and low predation populations. Variation in these traits will be correlated with differences in gene expression for hormone receptors and cognate hormone secretion, pheromone excretion, and somatosensory anatomy. Differences in social environments will be characterized by measuring the proportions of individuals in each population that are influential on and/or responsive to social their partners. Lastly, the combination of influential and responsive partners will be varied to measure how well different combinations cooperate, quantifying differences in social selection across populations. This work will provide some of the first experimental links between proximate mechanisms, variation in IGEs, and social selection.  Data will be archived and made publically available through Dryad Digital Repository and GenBank, as appropriate."

Many features and challenges of embryonic life are broadly shared across animals, but frog eggs are particularly tractable to study. Structures such as egg capsules protect and constrain the embryo inside, creating a trade-off of costs and benefits. Upon hatching, animals enter a new environment, with both new dangers and resources. When to hatch is an essential decision embryos make, based on environmental cues. Hatching is also a physical feat that embryos must perform. The ability to assess cues, to exit the egg, and to survive outside the egg all change as embryos develop. Thus, under the same conditions, what embryos can do and what they should do to survive also changes. This project will examine how and why development changes behavior, using embryos of red-eyed treefrogs that hatch up to 40% prematurely to escape threats to the egg. It will assess the importance of maturation, adaptive changes in decisions matched to abilities, embryonic learning, and how embryos use two kinds of information; simple cues of oxygen availability and complex vibrations that can indicate predator attack. It will improve our understanding of embryo lives, behavioral development, and how animals use different kinds of information to make decisions, including broadly important but poorly understood vibrational information. The adaptive behavior of embryos is accessible and appealing, and thus ideal for scientific education and outreach. This project will offer interdisciplinary biology-engineering training for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as Neotropical research and cross-cultural experiences for US students and Latin American interns. The PIs will work with the media, museums, and zoos to disseminate results broadly. They will offer research experiences for teachers and develop online multimedia resources for educators at multiple levels. New methods and tools developed by this project will facilitate other research on embryo behavior and animal responses to vibrational cues. <br/><br/>This project is an integrative study of the development and regulation of environmentally cued hatching in red-eyed treefrogs, for which multiple selective trade-offs shaping hatching timing are known. Embryos use cues in at least two sensory modalities for their hatching decision. Older embryos hatch more readily, but even 30%-premature embryos sometimes hatch within seconds of a cue. This project will assess: I) how the speed and success of hatching change across effector development, focusing on hatching glands; II) how sensor development changes sensitivity to cues and cue properties, addressing developmental changes in mechanoreception by the inner ear and lateral line vs. more consistent, early developed, oxygen sensing; and III) how hatching decision rules for responses to simple hypoxia cues and complex vibrational, and potentially tactile, physical disturbance cues are shaped by developmentally changing trade-offs, a history of stage-specific selection, and the earlier experiences of embryos. The team will use (a) histology and microscopy to characterize morphological changes, (b) respirometry to assess metabolic changes, (c) measures of vestibulo-ocular reflexes to assess otic function, and (d) macro-videography to analyze embryo behavior and hatching performance. They will assess ontogenetic changes in hatching under controlled hypoxia, vibration playback, and predator attacks, and develop new playback methods for separating motion and tactile components of physical disturbance cues. Mechanosensory stimuli and hypoxia are common cues for hatching across taxa. Moreover, vibrational signals and cues inform behavior in many other contexts, later in life, and oxygen availability shapes the behavior of many aquatic animals. Results from red-eyed treefrog embryos will advance our understanding of behavioral development and animal information use more broadly. Datasets will be deposited in DRYAD. Outreach materials, including images and video, will be posted on Warkentin's lab website or contributed to the Encyclopedia of Life or National Association of Biology Teachers web resource page."

In the face of climate change and other environmental challenges, society can no longer rely solely on past experience to understand and manage the living world. This award asks the question, ?What would it take to forecast ecological processes the same way we forecast the weather?? This project will development an operational ecological forecasting capability similar to weather forecasting that uses an iterative cycle between making forecasts, performing analyses, and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for building a forecast capacity, and also a crucial part of any decision making under high uncertainty. In addition to making ecology more relevant to management, near-term forecasts routinely compare specific, quantitative predictions to new data, which is one of the strongest tests of any scientific theory. This project will generate near-term forecasts that leverage ecological data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network and spanning a wide range of themes: leaf phenology, land carbon and energy fluxes, tick-borne disease incidence, small-mammal populations, aquatic productivity, and soil microbial diversity and function. This broad, comparative approach will be used to address cross-cutting questions about the nature of predictability in ecology and develop an overarching body of forecasting theory and methods.<br/><br/> The Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative (NEFI) will advance ecological knowledge at three levels: (1) overarching across-theme hypotheses about the predictability of ecological systems; (2) pressing within-theme questions about what drives process and predictability; and (3) advancing the tools and techniques that will enable an iterative approach to quantitative hypothesis testing. The overarching hypotheses of this project are that: (1) ecological predictability is more driven by processes error than initial condition error; (2) there are consistent patterns in the sources of uncertainty across themes; (3) across themes, spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated; and (4) spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated with limits of predictability. Overall, the answers to these questions address to what extent there are general patterns to ecological predictability, which would advance both our basic understanding of ecological processes and constrain the practical problem of making forecasts.<br/><br/>The expected outcomes of NEFI are to: (1) Disseminate data products and predictions that benefit society; (2) Develop new tools and cyberinfrastructure that enhances research and education; and (3) to promote teaching, training, and learning. Specific NEFI forecasts, such as tick-borne disease risk, aquatic blooms, carbon sequestration, and leaf phenology, are of direct relevance to society. Forecasts will be made available via open cyberinfrastructure that disseminates forecasts to the public and allows other ecologists to contribute new forecasts. To produce these forecasts, NEFI will develop an open-source statistical package, ecoforecastR, which will advance the tools and techniques beyond what is currently used by the community. Finally, in addition to the graduate students directly mentored through the project, NEFI will run an annual summer course on ecological forecasting that will train the next generation of ecologists."

The brain has evolved hardwired neural pathways for controlling key social behaviors like aggression and mating, but basic organizing principles of these neural circuits remain poorly understood. This project tests how pheromonal signals-- chemical signals that impact behavior of the receiving organism-- are used to guide reproduction-specific behaviors, and how the corresponding neural pathways are altered by social experience. Like many animals, male mice form dominance hierarchies that strongly influence their behavior, where aggression is reduced in low-status males and preserved or increased in high-status males. The present experiments examine how becoming familiar with new social partners changes the way their pheromonal signals are processed in the brain, shifting thresholds for triggering aggressive behavior in dominant and submissive animals. First, to examine the basic biological processes that underlie learning, the investigators use single-neuron recordings to test the cellular changes that alter their responses to familiar individuals. Second, the investigators use new tools for visualizing neural activity during active social interactions, evaluating how familiarity shapes the patterns of brain activity corresponding to both dominant and submissive partners. Overall, this work addresses the neural changes that allow animals to adapt their behavior to reflect the history of their social experience with others. The project also offers opportunities for local high school students and undergraduate trainees from diverse backgrounds to engage in neuroscience research, including the use of cutting-edge technologies, and includes the development and dissemination of educational materials for local elementary schools and a science museum.<br/><br/>Key social behaviors, such as aggression, reproduction, and parenting are controlled by conserved neural circuits with strong similarities across species. Despite their critical role, little is known about the pathways that translate sensory cues into male- and female-appropriate behaviors. This project characterizes neural coding and plasticity in the mouse vomeronasal system, which plays a key role in mapping social chemosignals onto sex-specific responses. The main hypothesis of this work is that distinct behaviors are mediated by dedicated pathways in the accessory olfactory system, which are selectively altered by social experience to reflect individual relationships. It focuses primarily on aggression, a core male behavior that is rapidly and reliably triggered by other males, yet is also dramatically altered as animals establish dominance relationships. To characterize experience-dependent changes in aggression, these experiments combine ex vivo cellular electrophysiology and in vivo imaging of activity in the accessory olfactory bulb, a key node for routing sensory signals to central behavioral networks. The resulting data will address basic principles of sensory coding in a circuit intimately linked to innate behaviors, as well as characterize a novel form of cellular plasticity that may support adaptive changes in diverse social interactions. Together, this work helps establish how the brain organizes and routes the sensory signals that guide stereotyped behavioral responses, while still allowing flexibility in interactions with familiar partners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the precise molecular details of how seeds develop and grow are not well understood.  The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of seed development, which in turn could have a beneficial outcome for production of seeds as a nutritious food source.  The project will also provide interdisciplinary education and training in genetics, genomics, bioinformatics, and molecular biology for high school teachers, undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.  High school science teachers will spend two summers in the laboratory, participating directly in research activities and developing inquiry-based learning modules related to plant biology research, which they will bring back to their classrooms. This partnership will establish long-term connections to teachers to increase their students' ability to analyze quantitative information and generate knowledge from scientific exploration. <br/><br/>Seed development in flowering plants is regulated, in part, by genes that are imprinted.  Gene imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon whereby alleles of genes are differentially expressed depending on whether they are inherited from the male or female parent.  To understand and manipulate seed biology to beneficial effect requires deciphering the regulation and function of imprinted gene expression. Recent studies have created catalogues of imprinted genes in diverse plant species, and have yielded important insights about the extent of imprinting and the types of genes subject to imprinted expression. However, it remains unclear whether all imprinting is functional, or whether some instances of imprinting are bystander events due to genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming processes. The major aims of this research project are to comprehensively evaluate the function of imprinted genes in seed development, to test whether pure epigenetic variation is sufficient to induce imprinting variation, and to understand the gene networks that regulate imprinting by taking advantage of natural variation in imprinting phenotypes. This research will have substantial outcomes in further determining the functional consequences of imprinting and in understanding epigenetic mechanisms that regulate imprinted expression, increasing our understanding of seed biology and role of natural variation in these processes. Finally, tools to precisely engineer the DNA methylome in a sequence specific manner will be developed, allowing a direct test of whether specific DNA methylation patterns are necessary and sufficient for imprinted expression. These tools have the potential to be functional in other plant and animal species."

Although behavioral states are pervasive throughout the animal kingdom, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are poorly understood. To address this problem, the researchers examine the brain mechanisms that underlie behavioral state generation in a simple animal model, the roundworm C. elegans. Specifically, they examine how groups of interacting neurons --or neural circuits-- contribute to the generation of behavioral states. C. elegans is an attractive system for these studies because its nervous system consists of just 302 neurons. Moreover, the connections between these neurons are already known. Thus, fundamental principles of neural circuit function can be rapidly discovered in this animal and then applied to more complex animals. The specific goals of the research plan are to (1) fully characterize behavioral states in C. elegans, (2) examine how groups of neurons interact during behavioral states, and (3) use new optical approaches to characterize brain-wide activity during behavioral states. These studies will yield new insights into how animals generate behavioral states, with implications for human well-being, public policy, and more. This research plan is integrated with an educational plan centered on developing an undergraduate laboratory course where students learn and apply modern neuroscience methods to study neural circuits. The course materials will be made freely available to other educators.<br/><br/>A full understanding of neural circuit function requires detailed knowledge across many scales of analysis: from molecular events in single neurons to large-scale patterns of neural activity to emergent animal behaviors. This research project bridges these scales of analysis in the context of neuromodulatory control of long-lasting behavioral states. Although almost all animals display long-lasting behavioral states, the neural mechanisms that allow animals to generate these states are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to dissect these mechanisms in the simple nervous system of the nematode C. elegans, linking specific sites of neuromodulator release to large-scale activity patterns and behavior. Aim 1: First, a novel imaging platform will be used to determine how all C. elegans behaviors co-vary over time as animals switch between behavioral states. Aim 2: Targeted mechanistic experiments will then be used to examine how specific neuromodulators allow for state-dependent coupling between premotor circuits to coordinate behaviors as animals switch states. Aim 3: Finally, a whole-brain calcium imaging approach will be used to examine brain-wide activity patterns during behavioral states. These studies will reveal fundamental neural mechanisms that allow animals to coordinate and structure their behaviors.

The answers to this fundamental question underpin the ability to understand and predict evolution. While trying to study this question by introducing mutations in the lab, it was learned that mutations very often result in the production of protein variants that do not fold correctly in space. In the living cell, there are several systems that assist the protein folding process (known as the cellular proteostasis network), and they help some of the mutant proteins fold correctly. By perturbing the proteostasis systems, the investigator hopes to learn more about the mutations that actually happen during protein evolution. This project will use the influenza viruses, which can evolve rapidly in the lab and chemical probes that can turn on and off various parts of the proteostasis machinery. The research is linked to developing and testing an outreach program targeted at the local homeschooled student community. Opportunities offered include high school student internships related to the research, chemistry demonstration shows, and the development and testing of biomolecule models for take-home experiments that teach students about evolution and protein folding.<br/><br/>This research is uncovering how metazoan proteostasis mechanisms beyond the HSP90 chaperone influence protein evolution at the molecular level. A battery of custom-designed chemical biology tools is used to perturb the composition and activities of key components of the metazoan proteostasis network with high precision using small molecules. The effects of these different proteostasis environments on protein evolutionary trajectories are studied by leveraging rapidly evolving RNA viruses propagating in metazoan cells, with a focus on influenza A. The highly interdisciplinary experimental approach encompasses deep mutational scanning of individual viral proteins, and optimized sequencing, modeling, and biophysical analysis strategies to enable quantitative assessment of the results. The outcomes will be a new appreciation for the complex interplay between the proteostasis network and client protein evolution, with important implications for understanding and predicting viral evolution at the molecular level. Testing roles of the proteostasis network in buffering protein evolution will also elucidate previously unknown functions of specific proteostasis network components. Thus, fundamental science contributions will impact fields ranging from virology and evolutionary biology to biophysics."

The goal of this project is to test this hypothesis. This project will uncover the molecular underpinnings of floral diversification, and provide key insight into the molecular biology of floral development in the economically important grass family, which includes corn and wheat.

In Aim 1, the impact of evolutionary variation in MADS-box dimerization on floral development will be explored using gene editing technology, microscopy, and geometric morphometrics. In an allied education aim, high school interns will assist with genotyping plant lines, and explore the people behind the science in a 'Heroes of Biology' journal club. In Aim 2, the genome-wide gene expression profiles downstream of evolutionary variation in MADS-box dimerization will be determined using RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq. In an allied education aim, undergraduates in the lab will design and perform qRT-PCR experiments to validate next-generation sequencing results. In Aim 3, the protein-protein interaction profiles of MADS-box dimer variants will be determined both in vitro and in planta. Sophomores in the PI's research-based molecular evolution class will test select MADS-box protein-protein interactions.

In the next six years they will study how forests respond to changes in climate, the spread of invasive species, and use of land by humans.

Collectively, the plot-based studies will be used to describe the drivers of primary production, composition, and structure across broad scales of space and time. To understand the consequences of observed trends in climate and atmospheric chemistry, the LTER program will continue to support a long-running suite of soil warming and chronic nitrogen addition experiments.

Understanding how tissues are formed and shaped during development is important for the prevention of birth defects and to understand how to repair wounded tissues, yet this remains largely unknown since the problem is very complex. Because the mechanisms underlying development are well-conserved in evolution, much can be learned from studying the development of simple organisms such as sea urchins. The proposed research focuses on the mechanisms underlying the patterning of the sea urchin larval skeleton, which is produced by one type of cell (mesodermal cells), reacting to signals from other cells on the surface of the embryo (ectodermal cells).  Previous work by this PI uncovered a number of ectodermal signals that serve as instructions for the skeletal pattern. The PI now proposes to determine how four of those signals each change the mesodermal cells to direct their movement within the embryo. This work will discover the sequence of all the RNA inside single cells in order to understand how these four signals alter which RNA and proteins are made in each of the sixty mesodermal. It will also identify and test the response to the four signals by receptor proteins in the mesodermal cells. In addition to performing scientific outreach in the Boston area, the PI will train students in scientific research, including female high school students in summer internships, undergraduate students performing independent studies, and graduate students seeking Ph.D.s.  <br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on the mechanism underlying skeletal patterning during sea urchin development. The skeleton is secreted by primary mesenchymal cells (PMCs), while the patterning information is contained within the ectoderm, and sensed by the migrating PMCs. The PI previously identified numerous novel ectodermal cues that pattern the skeleton, and here proposes to determine how four distinct and conserved cues (sulfated proteoglycans, 5-HETEs, VEGF, and Univin) modulate gene expression within the PMCs to promote their diversification by using single-cell mRNA sequencing on individual PMCs in control embryos and in embryos in which specific patterning cues are inhibited. The combined results from time-course and perturbation analyses will be integrated into a temporal network model for PMC diversification; this network will extend the previously determined early specification network for PMCs. Key genes in the new diversification network will be functionally tested using knockdown approaches combined with in vitro PMC migration analyses. A novel approach will be used to fix cells following in vitro migration while preserving their spatial positions, which will allow determination of the behavior of specific PMC subsets following migration toward or away from specific cues."

During development, this cell divides and its progeny turn on distinct subsets of genes to build different types of cells like those in muscles, nerves and blood.  This process is precise; tissues and organs are the correct size and shape and they occur in the correct position.  This process is also robust; development unfolds accurately under a wide range of environmental and genetic assaults. Yet changes to animal physiology in disease or evolution are often due to alterations to development. This award addresses this critical paradox: how does development both buffer against change, and yet respond and adapt to change to produce new creatures? With respect to broader impacts, fewer than 10% of entering life science Ph.D. candidates will attain tenure-track academic jobs.  Scientific training must therefore include skills that are useful in academia, government and the private sector.  This award will support efforts to teach scientists how to communicate effectively, which is a fundamental and universally valued skill.  The principal investigator will expand the scope of an innovative graduate course she directs, tailor it for undergraduates, and make modular materials available online so that other people can deploy it.  This teaching effort will lead to a new generation of scientists adept at communicating across disciplines and with the public, and with skills that are highly valued in careers outside of academia. <br/> <br/> The central hypothesis is that developmental precision and robustness are encoded in the circuits of gene regulatory networks, and by extension, the regulatory DNA that wires them together.  By studying how such circuits are built, and how they behave under perturbation, we can learn how they can be precise, robust and yet evolvable.  Shadow enhancers, distinct pieces of regulatory DNA that drive the same target gene expression pattern, increase the precision and robustness of developmental systems but the mechanism is unknown.  The DePace lab conducts their studies of gene regulatory networks in fruitfly embryos because the rules governing development are extremely similar between fruitflies and other animals, including humans, but fruitfly embryos offer substantial experimental advantages for deciphering the underlying principles.   The DePace lab recently uncovered a pair of shadow enhancers in fruitfly embryos that respond to the same regulator in opposite ways. This project will interrogate the function of this novel circuit using quantitative experiments and computational models. Aim 1 will determine how the activity of the bifunctional regulator (a transcription factor) is controlled.  Aim 2 will determine how the circuit affects patterning precision and robustness in the embryo.  This research will: 1) probe the molecular mechanism of transcription factor bifunctionality, a general problem in interpreting the genome, 2) determine the role of a novel transcriptional circuit in embryonic patterning precision and robustness and 3) establish a powerful model for studying the mechanism and consequences of distributed regulatory DNA, which is a significant but under-studied class."

This project aims to examine the conjugation machinery of Gram-positive bacteria using the integrative and conjugative element ICEBs1 of B. subtilis as a model system. Prior results indicate that the ICEBs1 T4SS is composed of ConE and ConB, among other proteins. ConE is a peripheral membrane ATPase that likely energizes DNA transfer and/or channel assembly. The bitopic membrane protein ConB interacts with ConE and is required for its association with the membrane. ConB and ConE will be characterized by a variety of methods including mutagenesis, conjugation assays, fluorescence microscopy, and biochemistry. This research will define the conserved sequence motifs and domains of ConB and ConE that are required for conjugation, interaction, enzymatic function, and oligomerization.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Sarabeth Buckley is ""Requirement for N-Acetylglucosamine Transporters in Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Symbiosis"" The host institution for the fellowship is the Cambridge University, UK, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Uta Paszkowski.<br/><br/>This research studies how plants and mycorrhizae, a soil fungus, communicate to form a symbiosis. Mycorrhizae attach to roots of most plants and help them grow. The plant provides the mycorrhizae with carbohydrates and the mycorrhizae provides plant roots with nutrients. To start this relationship, the plants and mycorrhizae communicate by sending chemical signals to each other, which are not fully understood. This project studies a protein in plants that is likely the first protein a plant needs to start communication. If the puzzle pieces of the entire process of communication can be identified and put together, that knowledge could be used to make plants grow better by enhancing this connection or introducing pieces of it to other plants. Increasing plant growth sustainably could help agricultural systems work with nature to grow more food and use carbon from the atmosphere. This training will provide critical skills as the fellow transitions from studying environmental science to plant molecular biology. Results from this research will be shared with the science community through conferences, but also the local community through programs such as those that increase opportunities for young women in science.<br/><br/>The protein of interest, NOPE1, is a N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transporter in plant roots. In mycorrhizae there is a homologous protein, NGT1. In the absence of NOPE1 a symbiosis between mycorrhizal fungus and roots cannot be established. This study answers 1. Are NOPE1 and NGT1 both essential for establishing a symbiosis and where are they expressed? 2. What is the signaling molecule transported by both? 3. How are molecules transported? It is hypothesized that: 1. Both NOPE1 and NGT1 are essential and are expressed close to where colonization occurs. 2. The molecules transported by NOPE1 and NGT1 are from both plants and fungi and are similar to N-acetylglucosamine. 3. NOPE1 and NGT1 transport these molecules both in and out of plant and fungus. Through this study the fellow will learn and use gene silencing, in situ hybridization, fluorescent tagging, and multiphoton confocal microscopy to observe gene expression. Relevant genes will be transferred to xenopus oocyte and to apply electro-physiological techniques in the presence of candidate molecules. Unknown molecules will be identified using LC-MS and NMR. RNAseq transcriptome analysis will provide insight into dynamics of downstream effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a question is of fundamental interest in neuroscience because responding to odors or scents is one of the most basic ecological abilities exhibited across different animal species.  Further, responses to odors are highly dependent on context.  For example, certain smells may create both attractive and repulsive reactions, depending on small differences in dilution or whether they are encountered alone or as components in a cocktail.  Thus, studying how the brain processes odors can provide important clues regarding how animals and humans sense and perceive in complex environments.  In seeking such understanding, this project uses a unique combination of methods from neuroscience, mathematics, and engineering.  Brain activity from two different animal species are recorded during experiments in which odors are presented in isolation and in mixtures.  Subsequently, data analysis and mathematical modeling is used to identify brain activity patterns that distinguish the reaction of the animals to the odors in question.  Hence, the project uncovers how particular brain networks transform and transmit odor information in a way that is central to the sense of smell.  To broaden the impact of these studies, the project includes the development of a summer internship in sensory neural engineering, intended to allow undergraduate and high school students to learn about and experience how different academic disciplines contribute to future brain science.<br/><br/>The extent to which sensory networks amplify or suppress perceived differences in odor valence remains a fundamental, unanswered question in sensory neuroscience.  The overarching hypothesis of this project is that indeed, there exists a well-defined set of transformations, governed by neuronal dynamics, which map sensory network activity to behavior.  Specifically, the project will determine: (a) How neural networks enable the formation of time-varying neural activation patterns, or, trajectories, in response to sensory stimuli, (b) The mapping from trajectories to behavioral outcome, and (c) The commonality of this mapping across species.  The research goals use an interdisciplinary approach combining sensory systems neuroscience in two species, locusts (Schistocerca americana) and round worms (C. elegans), with computational modeling and dynamical systems theory.  Neural and behavioral responses are recorded from animals receiving nominally attractive and aversive odors, and these data inform computational models of the sensory networks and ensuing behaviors.  The models generate predictions on how behavioral responses might be modulated by a change in selectivity, or background state.  The latter is tested through a paradigm wherein animals are systematically fed or starved, thus shifting their response dynamics on the aversive-attractive spectrum.  Subsequently, model-based sensitivity analyses is used to predict mixture response curves and paradoxical mixtures (e.g., two aversive stimuli that when mixed, elicit an attractive response).  These predictions are tested by delivering component stimuli in systematic ratios.  Thus, the overall methodology combines physiological experiments with new systems-level analysis in an integrated, multidisciplinary modeling-theory loop."

The light-sensing antenna of photoreceptor cells is an essential feature of the cells and must be continuously refreshed (or regenerated) in order to optimally capture light. Without this antenna, photoreceptor cells cannot sense light, and the photoreceptor cells die, resulting in blindness.  This continuous regeneration occurs by the addition of newly produced proteins and membranes at its base and by the shedding of the oldest proteins and membranes from its tip. Remarkably, the photoreceptor cell is capable of keeping its antenna at a constant length, as the dynamic processes of growth and shedding occur. The goal of this project is to discover the rules used by photoreceptor cells in the eye to determine the length of their antenna. In addition to understanding this vital regeneration process, this proposal will allow a new generation of STEM scholars to learn the skills that are vital to thrive in STEM disciplines. In particular, a cohort of students, undergraduates and graduate students, will participate in the research and gain vital training and mentoring in mathematical/computer modeling and life science. This project also incorporates activities to increase current and future participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education and careers.<br/><br/>This project seeks to discover the rules used by photoreceptor cells to calculate and balance rates of growth and shedding of proteins and membranes in their light-sensing antenna to maintain a constant length of their cellular antennas. Rules will be discovered using genetically manipulated zebrafish that reveal the dynamic regenerative process in the photoreceptor's antenna. One set of experiments is designed to stimulate extra growth at the base, and results will reveal whether antenna length increases or whether shedding increases to balance the extra growth rate to maintain a length constant. Another set of experiments is designed in which shedding from the tip will be blocked, and results will reveal whether antenna length will increase due to blocked shedding or whether growth at the base slows to balance the extra length at the tip to maintain a length constant. Finally, mathematical models will be developed to predict the length of photoreceptor antenna following experimental manipulation. Such models are based on our current understanding of growth and shedding, where model output will be fit/compared to experimental data of antenna length. The beauty of such a model is that it can be used to help reveal (and even predict, alongside with future experiments) the regulatory mechanisms that photoreceptors use to maintain the constant length of their sensory antennas. The outcomes of this proposal will serve as an important foundation for future efforts to define the cellular machinery in photoreceptors that contribute to the critical regenerative process of their light-sensing antenna.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way that visual systems accomplish this task is through selective attention, where an animal attends to a portion of the available visual stimuli at a time. Tiny jumping spiders have microminiature eyes that are nearly as acute as a human's and, like humans, pays attention and discriminates among visual targets. This project investigates how jumping spiders pay attention to and identify moving visual objects.  The simplicity of the jumping spider eye and brain makes it easier to learn how the brain's neural networks ""compute"" visual movement and object identification, than in humans.  In humans AND jumping spiders, selective visual attention is measured by rapid movements of their eyes to focus on targets of interest. This study employs an innovative eyetracker to measure the direction of a spider's gaze as it views video images. In addition, neural techniques are used to measure the activity of the spider's brain while its gaze is being monitored: specific parts of the brain respond differentially to particular images and sounds. Thus, it is possible to see both what engages a spider's visual attention as well as how different stimuli are interpreted. Understanding this elegant, miniaturized and extremely effective visual system will be of interest to roboticists and engineers, for whom micro-miniaturization of biosensors is a premium in small, self-autonomous robots. In addition, the PI will train a graduate student, a postdoc, and undergraduates, and will create videos for a project called ""Faces and Voices of Science"" that highlight the personal stories of researchers from different backgrounds. The videos will be made available online for teachers and professors to incorporate in lectures.<br/><br/><br/>Visual animals face the problem of distinguishing relevant from distracting stimuli quickly and efficiently.  One way to do this is through selective attention, where the animal attends to only part of the visual field at a time, through a process of saccadic eye movements and selective target scan.  This is true for humans and at the behavioral level seems true for jumping spiders.  These spiders are highly visual and are among the rare invertebrate animals that have moveable eyes.  The PIs have developed two novel technologies that allow a comprehensive study of selective visual attention.  These include an innovative spider eyetracker can monitor with precision a spider's eye movements in real time as they scan a stimulus image and the first electrophysiological recordings in the brain of a living spider as it observes visual stimuli. The eyetracker will be deployed to monitor eye movements while simultaneously recordings from single units in the brain are recorded.  The PIs will thus test explicit hypotheses about visual attention, eye movements, and correlated brain activity.  These include ""bottom-up"" stimulus-driven attentional processes by testing how different visual stimuli influence eye movements and neural processes in the brain, as well as ""top-down"" processes by presenting cross-modal cues and measuring eye movements and neural processes as the spider searches for relevant stimuli among distractors."

Rodenticides are arguably more dangerous, less effective, and less humane than introducing daughterless males into a population could be.  To determine whether daughterless males could safely replace rodenticides, the public would need to understand the effects of introducing daughterless males into animal populations.  In this project, the effectiveness of releasing daughterless males will be studied in laboratory populations of nematodes (worms), which can be genetically engineered more easily than mice, reproduce faster than mice, and can be grown in large laboratory populations.  Because the females, males, and daughterless males will be engineered to glow in different colors, the effect of daughterless males can be studied at the molecular and population levels simultaneously.  Because nematodes reproduce quickly, the project can study the consequences of introducing daughterless males over many generations.  These data will be used along with mathematics to predict the effects of introducing daughterless males into wild mouse populations, analogous to the way that meteorologists use observations to forecast the weather.  The predictions will be tested experimentally using genetically engineered daughterless male mice in the laboratory setting.  The principles learned in this research could be applied to understanding the impact of genetic engineering on control of any pest population.  The glowing worms will be used in museum workshops to educate citizens and invite participants to help determine how local communities can best guide democratic decisions about using genetically-engineered animals to replace rodenticide poisons.  <br/><br/>Male-female (dioecious) C. elegans will be generated and then further modified using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create targeted nuclease activity that selectively prevents development of female embryos.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. A fundamental goal in evolutionary biology is understanding how diversity in the form and function of organisms arises. Species differences in neural circuitry, i.e. wiring between neurons, are thought to be important for diversity in animal behavior. But the specific molecular changes that underlie divergence of neural circuits in different species is not known. This research aims to identify changes in gene expression within single neurons that cause divergent connectivity in the neural circuits underlying the swimming behaviors of two sea slug species. The neurons, neural circuits, and behaviors of these relatively simple animals are easily and directly comparable, making them uniquely suited to address this question. One way that neurons are connected is through direct electrical transmission mediated by structures called gap junctions, which are common to all nervous systems. This project investigates how species-specific patterns of connectivity arise, providing insight into the evolution of neural circuits underlying behavior. During this project, the Fellow will participate in multiple activities for broadening representation in biology, including mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds, and creating an interactive, field observation based outreach module aimed at K-8 students from surrounding communities.<br/><br/>The sea slugs Dendronotus iris and Melibe leonina are nudibranch molluscs that swim using an alternating homologous left-right motion. Furthermore, the neural circuits underlying this simple behavior are composed of homologous neurons, which are electrically coupled in species-specific patterns. The hypothesis being tested is that differences in expression of innexins in homologous neurons are responsible for the species differences in neural connectivity. The Fellow will learn a number of techniques to determine the role of innexins in species-specific patterning of electrical synapses, including single neuron RNA sequencing, single neuron quantitative real-time PCR, in situ hybridization and electrophysiology combined with RNAi and injection of synthetic mRNA. The outcomes of this project include more than 70 complete, single neuron transcriptomes with corresponding electrophysiological recordings, an innexin phylogeny, and in-situ hybridization to localize and compare innexin expression between neurons within the neural circuit for each species and between homologous neurons. The Fellow will also receive training in mentoring diverse students and directly mentor undergraduates in the lab as part of the STEM Ambassadors program at UMass. Finally, the Fellow will create a K-12 outreach module called ""Wonder in a drop of water"", where students from local schools will visit the UMass pond, explore invertebrate diversity using small portable microscopes to make field observations. This outreach module will be taught by 3rd year undergraduates from STEM Ambassadors, developing their own mentorship and leadership skills through outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The REU program, focused on integrative approaches to studying recognition systems in cells, organisms, and populations, will provide students the opportunity to work closely on collaborative, interdisciplinary projects combining faculty expertise in biochemistry, genetics, development, endocrinology, neurobiology, behavior, ecology, and conservation. Students will work with two mentors to design and conduct independent projects. In addition to research, the program includes weekly discussions, seminars, field trips, and two student symposia. The goals of this summer program are to increase student proficiency in biological research and collaborative skills, to educate and inspire students toward future research careers, and to develop student ability to effectively communicate scientific results. Accordingly, seminars are focused on proficiency in science/communication of results, scientific ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and career development. Participants are selected from a broad undergraduate applicant pool, and preference is given to students from underrepresented groups and those who might not have research opportunities at their home institution (e.g., community college students).<br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 36 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. The Department of Biology has a long-standing commitment to mentoring undergraduates in research, and a strong track record of highly productive interdisciplinary research collaborations. Student-mentor relationships typically extend long beyond the research experience and are facilitated via electronic networking tools. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences and/or in scientific papers. A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.
