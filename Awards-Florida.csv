The proposed project, known as ?CLEARED? for Culture of Living-biopsies for Emerging Airway-pathogens and REspiratory Disease, combines cutting-edge technologies in 3D-printing, soft tissue engineering, artificial-intelligence-enhanced imaging, human lung biology, and virology to understand the spread of COVID-19 in lungs. This will increase the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 biology and transmission. The researchers have developed the technology to grow portions of lung into living 3D-printed tissue structures that resembles the architecture found in the lung in a liquid-like-solid matrix. Thus, this system more closely resemble the environment in living humans versus standard cell culture. After infecting these samples with SARS-CoV-2 virus, advanced imaging of these ?living biopsies? will be used to study virus spread from cell to cell, and the efficacy of therapeutic treatments. Outcomes of the proposed research include: (i) Validating a standard model system using human lung biopsies and known diagnostics in response to SARS-CoV-OC43 infection; (ii) Determining how the disease develops and spreads in biopsies infected with different human and bat coronavirus strains. It is expected that this system will allow scientists to better understand virus transmission and prevention. This project also supports the training of three graduate students, leading to an increase in future workers to drive the bioeconomy.<br/><br/>The proposing team hypothesizes that controlled perfusion of SARS-CoV-2 in 3D culture models of human respiratory microtissue explants can recapitulate early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease. To test this hypothesis, PIs will establish a 3D model of viral infection using living microtissue explants of human bronchus and peripheral lung, quantify the early responses to viral infection using a novel 3D tissue culture platform, and determine the spatiotemporal pathogenesis of different human and bat coronaviruses strains. Preliminary data show that SARS-CoV-2 indeed infects the micro-tissues of bronchus and peripheral lung. This is a transdisciplinary team of investigators from Astronomy, Chemistry, Medicine, Engineering, Virology and lung biology.  The proposed work is organized by two tasks. Task 1 will validate a standard model system using human lung biopsies and known host-response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Readouts will include viral titer, cytokine production and spatiotemporal imaging of viral replication in response to coronavirus infection. Task 2 will determine the spatiotemporal pathogenesis of human lung biopsies infected with different human coronavirus strains (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-2) and one bat strain (btCoV-HKU3). The heterogenous nature of biopsies will alter the viral titer and cytokine production of biopsies compared to measurements in cell lines, and will provide superior information about progression and virus spread through tissues than standard cell culture technology. This RAPID award is made by the Physiological and Structural Systems Cluster in the BIO Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Woodland salamanders can have different color patterns (color polymorphisms) in the same populations. Color types (morphs) are not simply different colors, they also vary in behavior, body form, and ecology. Long-term persistence of multiple color morphs remains an evolutionary puzzle, as previous studies have suggested that selection should either lead to one color morph dominating or formation of separate differently colored species. The aim of this project is to examine the evolution of a striped/unstriped color polymorphism in woodland salamanders using data collected from several U.S. natural history museums. Archived tissue samples will be used to understand the evolutionary relationships of salamanders. The fellow will also take digital images of polymorphic salamanders using high-throughput approaches, which will subsequently be identified as striped or unstriped by community scientists, and through machine learning approaches. The fellowship will facilitate mentorship training and foster opportunities for undergraduates who are interested in research. The fellow will collaborate with local high schools and participate in outreach events to share the results of this research. <br/><br/>Within the genus Plethodon, a striped/unstriped color pattern polymorphism has either independently originated 10 times or has been lost in 14 species that are fixed for a single morph. Extensive research on one polymorphic species (P. cinereus) suggests that the color morphs are associated with distinct sets of morphological and ecological traits. Thus, this system presents an ideal opportunity to test: 1) the origin and evolution of the polymorphism; 2) climatic niche overlap between morphs and species with divergent phenotypes; 3) whether there are non-random patterns of co-adapted trait complexes that evolved in Plethodon; and 4) how quickly those traits respond to fluctuating environmental conditions, including rapid environmental changes in the present. Using phylogenetic comparative approaches, the fellow will assess the relationship between intra-specific patterns and macroevolutionary outcomes within Plethodon, which represents a critical next step in understanding the evolution of this widespread polymorphism. This work is enabled by an interdisciplinary approach to use biological collections, while leveraging machine learning, and citizen scientist efforts. The end results will provide essential new knowledge about the evolution of color morphs and the relationship between polymorphism and diversity. Citizen science, mentoring of undergraduate students and outreach will broaden the impact of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research investigates the contributions of the shark cartilaginous vertebral column, skin, and animal movements that tune the body during swimming. Shark vertebrae work as springs, which store and return energy based on the species-specific arrangement of mineral in the cartilage. Shark skin contains mineralized teeth, which make the skin feel like sandpaper and are hypothesized to resist stretching. During swimming, the movements of both the body and the tail can vary among different species. By studying these three levels of organization individually, the influence of hard and soft tissues on overall body performance can be modeled and understood in sharks swimming at different speeds. The results of this research will provide information about swimming, and inspiration for both stiff and stretchy synthetic materials. The research will be conducted at Florida Atlantic University, a Hispanic Serving Institution that is considered to have one of the most diverse student populations in the United States. The project will support advancement of a female assistant professor, whose laboratory draws diverse graduate, undergraduate, and dual-enrolled high-school researchers from a student population in which 26% of STEM majors are Hispanic. The principal investigator will teach an Animal Locomotion course in which students develop active-learning-focused content that is shared in open-access education journals and then disseminated locally at nature centers and museums. This work facilitates collaboration with researchers studying machine learning and ocean and mechanical engineering.<br/><br/>Stiffness imparted from the vertebral column and skin, which tune an animal?s body, can impact swimming speed and style. This research links the contributions of both mineralized (cartilaginous vertebrae) and soft (skin) biological materials to animal movement. The mineral amount and arrangement impact mechanical properties like stiffness in cartilage and skin, but there are complex interspecific morphological variations that are not understood. The vertebral column contains repeating centra that yield, or permanently deform at high stresses, creating a mechanical space wherein the cartilage can operate without permanent damage, and the impacts of body tuning can be explored. Similarly, this research will examine the tiny mineral inclusions (dermal denticles) that have been shown to impact stiffness of the skin and potentially the whole body. Mechanical properties and mineralization patterns of cartilage and skin from several shark species will be quantified using material testing and CT scanning. Preliminary video data show that some species of shark can swim using a double oscillating system, where frequency of movement varies in the anterior to posterior direction, and these mechanics may be facilitated by passive stiffness from the vertebrae and skin. The work facilitates collaboration with researchers through university programs and partnerships including the university lab school. The PI will impact the larger scientific community in South Florida by organizing a seminar series on campus, in which graduate students interact and network with marine scientist speakers from educational, industry, and non-profit organizations. Research findings will be shared with the general public, including K-12 students, at local nature centers and science museums.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They store carbon, reduce erosion, and serve as habitat for other species. The factors influencing trees, and the spatial scales at which they are managed, range from an individual tree to entire continents. Since there are approximately three trillion trees in the world collecting data on every tree over large areas is impossible using traditional methods. Therefore, it is necessary to use new technology to measure and describe individual trees over large geographic areas. This research will address this fundamental challenge by combining high resolution remote sensing data with field data on trees. Together, the remote sensing and field data will be used to understand what influences the number of trees, their size, where different species occur, and how this changes from spatial scales of local parks to the entire United States. This project will also make it easier for other scientists to study trees over large areas by developing software, producing data products, and providing training and collaboration opportunities for working with these novel datasets. This will help drive rapid advances in the cross-scale understanding of tree ecology with broad applications in forestry, management, and fundamental scientific understanding.<br/><br/>This project combines National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data from airborne remote sensing and field data collection. These data will be used to develop machine learning based approaches to identify, measure, and characterize to species all of the canopy trees located within each forested NEON site. This will yield data on approximately 50 million individual trees at about 40 sites across the United States. These data from NEON will be combined with data from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Project, which samples millions of trees at over 100,000 locations across the United States. These combined data will be used to develop joint models of the distribution, abundance, and structural traits of trees, that explicitly incorporate the concept of scale. These models will be used to understand how the processes influencing tree distribution and traits change across scales by comparing the importance of different factors at scales ranging from a few meters, where individual trees directly interact, to the entire United States, where large gradients in climate and land use are important. This research will address three broad questions in ecology: 1) what processes govern species distribution and abundance at different scales and how do they interact? 2) how are landscape and regional process of species coexistence connected to local biodiversity? 3) how do changes in the processes influencing tree traits across scales impact estimates of biomass and carbon storage?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This goal of understanding biodiversity dynamics is enabled at a critical moment when human systems are disrupting those very dynamics. However, the scientific and computational tools needed to derive understanding from data are still missing.  Such tools need to be accessible to a broad community of users, thereby catalyzing involvement and innovation.  This project will (1) build a computational model for multiple aspects of biodiversity-species abundance, genetic, functional, and phylogenetic; (2) use and refine this model by testing major hypotheses about the generation and maintenance of biodiversity in three exemplar systems; (3) make the model accessible to the scientific community by building an open-source platform to prepare diverse data sources and run the model; and (4) create pedagogically effective courses and workshops to enable students, researchers, and stakeholders from many backgrounds to understand biodiversity theory and the data science tools needed to test those theories with data.<br/><br/>The Rules of Life Engine (RoLE) model will be a mechanistic, simulation-based hypothesis-testing and data synthesis framework enabling scientists with multi-dimensional biodiversity data to generate and test hypotheses about the processes driving biodiversity patterns. The RoLE model will apply new techniques in machine learning to fit models to high dimensional, cross-scale data. The model will simulate eco-evolutionary community assembly building from individual-based ecological and genetic neutral models with added non-neutral, trait-based competition and environmental filtering. New species and traits will arise through long time scale evolution in the meta-community and rapid evolution in the local community. Population genetics and species abundances in the local community will be modeled through birth, death, immigration, and mutation. The project research team will refine and illustrate the use of the RoLE model by testing four hypothesized rules of life across three bio-geographic systems for which multi-scale biodiversity data are now available. The hypotheses address the relative roles of immigration versus speciation in community assembly, how species interactions influence diversity, how different assembly histories determine the strength of species interactions, and whether/how systems come to equilibrium. The project leaders have established a network of 14 collaborators, including the National Ecological Observatory Network, who will use the RoLE model in their diverse systems and propagate wider adoption. In order to further reduce barriers to use, the RoLE model framework will be made available as open source software, including an R language Shiny App interface with standardized metadata outputs to promote reproducibility and sharing. The insights gained from the RoLE model are of direct relevance to conservation, e.g., whether or not communities are assembled primarily by speciation or immigration strongly determines their response to anthropogenic pressures and optimal conservation management. To encourage participation in quantitative biodiversity research, the project leaders will develop a massively open online course through the Santa Fe Institute?s Complexity Explorer program using the RoLE model as an interactive teaching tool. In conjunction with Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry, the research team will also provide an in-person data science training workshop.

In vitro these assemblies exhibit superb protonic conductance, comparable to the-state-of-the-art artificial materials. This project will elucidate the molecular mechanism underpinning the tunable coloration and superb protonic conductivity of reflectins. This knowledge will enable rational design of bio-compatible artificial materials based on reflectins with programmable optical and electrical properties. Multiple undergraduates and one graduate will be trained. The PI will exploit the fascinating nature of the protein in his outreach activities for local K-12 schools to promote STEM and to inspire next general scientists and engineers.<br/><br/><br/>Several conserved amino acid sequences were found in homologous reflectins, recapitulating the properties of the full-length proteins. The intriguing optical and electrical properties were attributed to the ordered hierarchical structures and accompanied hydrogen bonding network in assemblies.

This project will apply solid state NMR (ssNMR), the ideal technique for noncrystalline sample, to determine the atomic structural model of the assembly formed by one of the conserved fragments called (ref2C)4. This knowledge will resolve the paradox: how largely disordered subunit proteins assemble into ordered Bragg reflectors at light wavelength scale to modulate optical properties.

The Academy recommended that synthetic biology be a tool to address such big questions in life science. Synthetic biology goes beyond descriptive biology, which investigates only the one example of life that the natural history on earth has given us.  This project implements synthetic biology to examine the plausibility of alternatives to DNA, which is the primary unit of heredity of life on earth.  This project also emphasizes a public outreach effort and the training of early career scientists.  <br/><br/>A novel synthetic chemical system that supports Darwinian evolution will be delivered through this project, which fits the MCB emphasis on ""synthetic biology?capturing the power of mechanistic, quantitative, and evolutionary approaches"". The ""alien"" Darwinian biopolymer will have four informational building blocks (PZBS, hypothesized as an optimal number), a polyelectrolyte backbone (hypothesized necessary for Darwinism), and inter-heterocycle hydrogen bonding (hypothesized required for directionality) in the transfer of genetic information as standard GACT DNA does. This will be the first example of a Darwinian system that does not include any natural building blocks. Further, PZBS DNA adds ""skinny"" and ""fat"" pairing to Watson-Crick size-complementary pairing, informational structures and functionality unavailable to standard GACT DNA.  PZBS DNA will be synthesized chemically and characterized. Polymerases to support PZBS biopolymers amplification will be evolved by compartmentalized self-replication. For sequencing, a transliteration technique to sequence GACTPZ six-letter DNA will be used; creative re-purposing of this will sequence PZBS DNA. PZBS libraries will then be placed under selection pressure to evolve functional PZBS molecules. Crystallography will be applied throughout to advance nucleic acid theory as the PZBS system is advanced.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insects use their brains to coordinate quick and accurate aerial maneuvers, but with coarse eyes that are immovably fixed in their heads, they cannot stabilize images the way humans do. The result is significant motion blur of objects they need to see in order to fly. How insect brains can so quickly gather information from a fast-moving image, then process it to generate appropriate flight responses, is an important, unresolved problem in visual science. These experiments study the steering efforts of tethered and freely flying fruit flies as they are presented with moving images under increasingly challenging circumstances, such as dim light and low contrast. The results will contribute to better understanding animal flight, human vision, and improve the performance of autonomous robots, such as flying drones. This project produces outreach and training opportunities to impact underrepresented groups through three activities. First, training undergraduates at Florida International University, most of whom identify from traditional minority groups, to carry out some of the laboratory work. Second, hosting in the lab at-risk local high school students from a non-profit organization that aims to inspire at-risk and delinquent youth. Third, demonstrating a portable version of these experiments to the Miami Science Museum's annual Brain Fair, a community outreach event with local neuroscientists directed at teaching brain and behavioral sciences to children in the broader Miami area.<br/><br/>The goal of this work is to determine the consequences of photon noise that is coupled to self-motion, and reveal the neural and behavioral mechanisms flies use to counteract its effects. The discrete and random nature of light absorption dictates that when photons are scarce, images suffer from low signal to noise ratios. This occurs whenever light intake is limited, such as when the environment is dim, or when eyes are physically small, or when objects move quickly across the visual field, which is often an inevitable result of quick flight. This project aims to determine how the fruit fly nervous system contends with degraded images just when it needs accurate visual information to coordinate responsive aerial movements. Tethered flies will view quickly moving projected patterns, which will establish the relationship between flow-induced photon noise, regional acuity, and attention. In the next stage, freely flying flies moving through obstacles will help determine the trade-offs of flight-induced noise and steering decisions, in other words the behavioral strategies that address and possibly minimize flow induced signal noise. And finally, sharp electrode elecrophysiological recordings will characterize spatial and temporal responses in early visual neurons while they view fast-moving patterns, which will then form the basis of biological models for viewing fast optic flow. The results of this project will offer neurobiological insight to the study of visual performance in moving animals, and practical insight to the design of artificial visual systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this day, the most fundamental and common way to accomplish this relies on organism names, making these one of the pillars of querying and managing our biological knowledge and data. However, the traditionally used names for organisms and groups of organisms, which are based in Linnaean nomenclature, suffer from two major limitations to their usefulness when it comes to integrating and communicating data. First, because they are simple text-strings, the meaning intended by those who coin a name and those who apply it is inaccessible to machines. As a result, exactly which organism a name is or is not meant to include is often ambiguous, and names are therefore often applied inconsistently. Second, there are many groups of organisms that do not yet and may never have a Linnaean name, but for which molecular or macroscopic characteristics have been discovered that constitute valuable biological knowledge. This project aims to address these issues by generating a mechanism, called phyloreferencing, that allows referring to any group of organisms of shared evolutionary descent by a machine-interpretable definition of the unique pattern of descent that distinguishes the group from all others. This project builds on more than a decade's worth of theoretical and applied research into phylogenetic taxonomy. With the recent synthesis and continuous update of a universal phylogenetic Tree of Life, phyloreferences will have immediate and broad practical applications for communicating, integrating, and querying biological data across the Tree of Life. In contrast to authoritative nomenclatural naming, the goal for phyloreferences is that users can construct them instantly for any group of shared evolutionary descent for which they wish to communicate discoveries. In addition to developing the phyloreferencing standard and supporting tools, this project also aims to create classroom-ready teaching materials and curricula for training biology students in the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of phylogenetic nomenclature. <br/><br/>The phyloreferencing mechanism that this project will develop uses standards and tools developed for the Web, specifically the Web Ontology Language (OWL), ontologies, and machine reasoning. Specifically, this work aims to develop phyloreferences as OWL class expressions consisting of sufficient and necessary conditions, which machine reasoners can use to identify subclasses and class instances. Ontology and reasoning technologies have already shown their power for biological knowledge integration and discovery and are increasingly being adopted for evolutionary research as well. As part of this project, a specification for constructing and computing with phyloreferences within an ontological framework will be researched, implemented, and tested. Phyloreferences will be designed with the goal that any element, whether node, branch, or clades, on the Tree of Life can be referenced in a way that is unambiguous and has fully computable semantics defined by patterns of evolutionary relatedness. The main objectives of this research include creating a formal specification for phyloreference and phylogeny encoding and reasoning in OWL; ascertaining correctness of the specification using small-scale tests verifiable by domain experts; and finally scaling the approach to a large-scale biodiversity data resource navigation proof-of-concept application. Specifically phyloreferences will be developed and integrated into Open Tree of Life, ARBOR and projects newly funded by the Genealogy of Life program.

This study examines a simple, yet novel, hypothesis to explain why so many animals have evolved elaborate and seemingly arbitrary traits and colors that they display to prospective mates during courtship. This project uses ideas from multiple fields of biology and psychology to test the idea that preferences learned in one context (such as a preference that an animal learns for a specific color of food) can affect the formation of preferences in another context (such as a preference for that same color when choosing a mate). These ideas will be tested in two species of jumping spiders: a Kenyan species that eats female mosquitoes (specifically, the vector of human malaria) where red colored food is preferred and an American species that feeds on many agricultural pests and where red colored food is avoided.  Work will alter female food color preference and then determine how this impacts the colors that females look for in mates. Both of these species play critical roles in their respective food webs; understanding how their populations respond to changes in prey have important implications for human health and agriculture. The study will engage several undergraduate student researchers, who will learn the scientific process through hands-on experience. In addition, it will fund the participation of several non-science majors at a local community college to improve scientific literacy among future leaders in other fields (e.g., politics, business, education). In addition to traditional scientific publication, the team will also disseminate findings in a collaborative art exhibit entitled Arachnophilia (to take place in both the US and Kenya).<br/><br/>Despite nearly 150 years of research to understand the mechanisms that drive the evolution of elaborate male ornamental traits biologists frequently stumble upon puzzling patterns in nature that challenge existing theory (e.g., yearly fluctuations in mate preferences, unexpected patterns of geographic variation in ornamentation and preference, and the presence of seemingly arbitrary ornaments). Clearly, the current theory falls short of fully explaining the complexity in nature. This study integrates ideas from across three distinct paradigms in animal behavior (sensory traps, sexual imprinting, and cross-contextual learning). It proposes a novel mechanism for the rapid evolution of male display traits: that an individual cannibalistic female's recent experiences with colorful food will shape how she interprets a male's colorful courtship display. Despite its simplicity, this idea could explain broad patterns of diversification and be applicable to a wide range of taxa. Using correlational field studies and manipulative lab experiments, this idea will be tested in two jumping spider species: Evarcha culicivora (a specialist on Anopheles mosquitoes in Kenya) and Habronattus pyrrithrix (a generalist predator from the southwestern USA). This study involves reversing the prey color preferences of these two species by exposing them to different types of naturally-occurring colorful foods and evaluating subsequent effects on mate preferences. This study capitalizes on the charismatic courtship displays of male jumping spiders to creatively link research, science education, and outreach. Work will be carried out by teams of undergraduate researchers (including non-science majors at a community college) and will be disseminated through a collaborative art exhibit."

This research project tests a new idea, that learning also importantly involves molecular changes in other parts of nerve cells which control the production of electrical activity required for these cells to communicate with each other. Learning is studied in the context of how young songbirds learn to sing, which happens in a similar way to how humans learn to speak, play a musical instrument, or produce any complicated sequence of behavior. Using a combination of behavioral observation and recording together with anatomical, physiological, molecular, computational and statistical techniques, the research team will test the hypothesis that developmental singing changes are accompanied by changes in cell electrical activity that are not located at synapses. They will also identify the mechanistic basis for these electrical changes. This research will reveal important new details about how the brain can store learned information for an entire lifetime. It will also provide student research assistants with broad multidisciplinary training, as well as developing new analytical software and computational models that will benefit the broader neuroscience community (these will be made freely available through a publically-accessible web site). Neuroscience and mathematics videos tagged to specific State-mandated high school learning objectives will also be produced, which will be made available to teachers via a cataloged State portal. Finally, the research team conducts a wide variety of community education programs specifically related to neuroscience, birdsong, and learning.  These activities include programs for K-12 schools as well as a scholarly course for senior citizens.<br/><br/>Much is known about the brain areas and circuits that underlie birdsong learning. Consequently, scientists know where to look for learning-induced changes (an area named HVC), but they do not know what neural changes encode the auditory memories of song. The proposed research tests the novel hypothesis that changes in specific, non-synaptic ionic currents in HVC neurons contribute to the encoding of auditory memories. Songbird auditory learning can be readily manipulated by controlling exposure to a tutor song. Preliminary data show that the intrinsic cell body/axonal channel properties of HVC neurons change in an experience-dependent manner during song development. The research team's recent characterization and modeling of the ionic currents that determine the physiology of HVC neurons in the adult finch now allow for the proposed developmental studies. Proposed studies will test hypotheses about the developmental emergence of specific ionic currents as they relate to sensory learning. This will lead to testable hypotheses about the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for this learning. As part of this project, the team will also correct mistaken views about HVC of female zebra finches. Long thought to lack male-typical connectivity, new data show that female and male HVC have the same cell types and patterns of extrinsic connectivity. Since females show auditory learning of tutor song, but do not sing, analysis of female HVC will provide a critical test of the proposed hypotheses. Together, the proposed experiments will provide clues to fundamental questions about how early sensory information is stored as a stable memory trace that lasts a lifetime."

If you were to read this sentence aloud, you would utter a precise, ordered sequence of over 50 distinct vocal sounds in less than 10 seconds.  How does the brain store the individual sounds of speech and then coordinate the production of these sounds in a meaningful order so quickly?  A similar question could be asked about the pianist performing a Mozart sonata, the songs of birds, or the mating dances of insects.  How the brain stores these elaborate sequences of behavior remains unknown.  Using the songbird zebra finch, a model organism that learns meaningful sequences of vocal sounds like humans do, the interdisciplinary research team will test the hypothesis that the brain encodes and stores sequences of behavior through two separate mechanisms that operate in parallel: one coding mechanism for the sequence of vocal sounds and one for the vocal sounds themselves.  Given the diversity of animal species that display elaborate, meaningful sequences of behavior, the findings will influence understanding across a broad array of organisms, including humans.  The research plan coordinates the activity of a faculty research team from four different disciplines (Neuroanatomy, Neurophysiology, Mathematics, and Statistics) and will provide students with a unique interdisciplinary training opportunity and environment.  <br/><br/>Observed in nearly all animal forms (and exemplified by human speech) serial order in behavior consists of learning to organize a set of elemental gestural units into a purposeful sequence of action. Adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) produce a highly quantifiable example of serial order in behavior (birdsong).  Moreover, a premotor cortical region (HVC, proper name) is known to encode a consolidated premotor trace of song. Although consisting of similar cell types, the medial and lateral portions of HVC are hypothesized to encode the sequence (medial HVC) and syllables (lateral HVC) of song in parallel. The research team will test whether these two dimensions of song are encoded by physiological differences in 1) afferent input to medial and lateral HVC, or 2) the intrinsic network properties of medial and lateral HVC (or a combination of 1 and 2). However, parallel encoding of serial order in behavior should be hierarchical, with traces for sequence in a supervisory position over traces for elemental gestural units. The team will also test whether efferent axons emanating from medial and lateral HVC interact in a hierarchical fashion within vocal-motor cortex. Results will elucidate a network architecture for serial order in behavior and provide a computational platform to understand how learning new sequences shapes such memory architectures."

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a single antioxidant/detoxification response transcription factor named SKN-1. The principle investigator of this award has made the surprising discovery that osmotic and genetic distortion of the cuticle activates several SKN-1- dependent cytoprotective genes and that SKN-1 strongly influences cuticle structure and expression of cuticle remodeling genes. The central hypothesis for the research in this CAREER award is that SKN-1 is activated by a cuticle associated environmental stress sensor and that SKN-1, in turn, directs or modifies cuticle synthesis or remodeling during stress or aging. Nematode parasites damage 80 billion dollars worth of crops each year, burden animal husbandry, and infect 1/3 of humans world-wide. Therefore, this project is an important starting point for a basic understanding of how SKN-1 and the nematode cuticle interact to influence resistance to pesticides, anti-parasitic drugs, and plant and animal host-immune responses. A new advanced research course will train a generation of beginning scientists on molecular genetics research and foster collaboration among seven C. elegans laboratories studying a broad range of topics. Additional outreach activities will directly improve STEM training and literacy for high school students and teachers, many from predominantly underserved communities.<br/> <br/>SKN-1 and its homologs are master regulators of cytoprotective genes that promote stress resistance and longevity throughout the animal kingdom. The study objectives are to leverage molecular and genetic approaches in C. elegans to: 1) identify osmotic signaling from the cuticle to SKN-1; 2) investigate whether, why, and how SKN-1 modifies the cuticle; 3) develop C. elegans learning modules and a teacher workshop; and 4) teach an advanced C. elegans research course for beginning scientists from seven labs. Biochemical assays, RNA interference approaches, transcript profiling, histologic and ultrastructure analyses, and genetic studies will be performed to achieve these objectives. Osmolarity is one of the most broadly shared and ancient forms of homeostasis. This project will provide novel genetic and molecular insights into osmo-sensing and signal transduction. For many of the same reasons that it is a powerful research model (e.g., simple and inexpensive, but permits sophisticated genetic and molecular approaches), C. elegans has tremendous unmet potential in education. The PI will collaborate with an institutional pre-collegiate training program and high school teachers to develop and implement learning modules and training workshops that utilize RNA interference and green fluorescent protein technologies to stimulate interest in gene regulation and demonstrate broad application of basic research. Results from the studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at regional and national scientific meetings."

Today in the Brazilian Amazon, construction of more than 30 large hydroelectric dams, and approximately 170 smaller dams on tributaries of the Amazon River are underway as a result of long-term governmental plans geared toward increased energy security, economic growth, improved living standards and industrialization. Despite the long history of hydropower development in Brazil, the synergistic, cumulative and long-term effects of dams on rivers, forests, and social systems are still undervalued in planning and decision-making. Uncertainty about the social-ecological effects of dam construction is due in large part to the existing piecemeal approach to analyzing the impacts of dams.  This uncertainty highlights an urgent need for coordinated research. The Amazon Dams Network will bring together a diverse set of stakeholders, including fishermen, indigenous peoples, farmers, scientists, students, and decision-makers to address this need.  Working together, the network will integrate and coordinate research on how dam construction and operations affect people, their livelihoods, and the environment.  Sharing of knowledge, data and technology will occur through workshops, case-study modules, a bilingual website, maps, and published data and papers.  <br/><br/>The goal of the Amazon Dams Network is to advance inter- and trans-disciplinary research coordination, focusing on the transformation of social-ecological systems by hydroelectric dam construction in the Amazon and United States. The geographical focus initially includes the Tocantins, Madeira and Xingu River watersheds in the Amazon and the Colorado River watershed in the US. Network activities will focus on four critical integrative themes: a) governance and social actors (an overarching and cross-cutting theme that mediates interactions and outcomes in dammed systems); b) watershed hydrology and geomorphology; c) fish and fisheries; and d) land-use/land-cover change.  Focal intersections among these themes to be addressed by the network include feedbacks between hydrologic change and forest ecosystems; human geographic dislocations and land-use change; monitoring and mitigation approaches for Brazilian dams; and the relevance of local knowledge (fishermen, indigenous peoples, riparian communities) for the study and management of systems transformed by infrastructure development. The network will enable data discovery and synthesis, sharing of knowledge, and inter- and transdisciplinary and social learning among participants and the public through a series of activities held at research sites in Brazil and the US, the creation of web-based learning and case studies modules, and the archiving of publically available data."

Understanding how these viral associations evolve is thus essential for a holistic view on the evolution of a broad diversity of organisms. Parasitoid wasps (wasps that grow within and kill other insects) are a natural laboratory for understanding the evolution of viral symbiosis because they are highly diverse and have evolved repeated associations with viruses. These viruses are able to suppress the immune defense mechanisms of the insect hosts that are parasitized by the wasps, enabling the wasps to survive and reproduce. Parasitoid wasps also provide substantial economic benefits to society because they are natural enemies of insect pests that cause damage to forests and agricultural crops. This project investigates the evolution and interactions between one of the most astonishing radiations on Earth (braconid parasitoid wasps, with 19,000 species) and the massive untapped diversity of their symbiotic viruses. The long-term goal is to understand the rules that govern the associations of the viruses, the wasps, and the hosts of the wasps. This research project advances knowledge in several ways: (1) discovery of new biodiversity in two poorly studied areas of the tree of life--viruses and wasps; (2) resolution of the evolutionary history and age of wasp-viral symbioses; (3) discovery of predictive genomic traits for viral symbiosis to understand the rules that govern these interactions; (4) characterization of the function of viruses; and (5) generate publicly available genome data. The proposed work will substantially transform understanding of symbiotic viral evolution, which will provide general information about virus evolution. The researchers will integrate wasp and viral research with education and public outreach by working closely with teachers in local schools and developing new educational resources. Furthermore, the program will improve STEM education and educator development and increase public literacy and engagement in STEM.<br/><br/>This project integrates phylogenetic, functional, and genomics approaches to discover the rules that govern mutualistic associations between viruses and wasps and, in turn, the interactions between these parasitoid wasps and their hosts. The overall objectives are to resolve and date the evolutionary relationships of the wasp family Braconidae using new methods of DNA analysis, discover which wasp lineages are associated with mutualistic viruses and the timing of their domestication, determine how viruses affect the antagonistic interactions between the wasps and their hosts, and examine genome features related to viral mutualism. The researchers aim to: (1) Resolve and date deep and shallow nodes for one of the most diverse lineages (19,000 species) on Earth; (2) Discover and characterize the multiple origins of viral symbiosis in Braconidae; and (3) decipher the roles of viral symbionts in the biology of the parasitoid wasps and their hosts. The outreach plan has two main components: 1) Providing research internships in the lab for local K-12 teachers so that they may learn new research techniques that will improve their teaching; and 2) using immersive virtual reality and animation experiences to engage the public and enhance learning in undergraduate education. The researchers will also provide integrated research and training opportunities to underrepresented mentees (2 postdoctoral researchers, 7 undergraduate and 2 graduate students) across the disciplines of phylogenetics, functional and comparative genomics, and revisionary systematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will focus on cycads, an unusual group of seed plants that originated around 270 million years ago. Today, cycads are among the most threatened plants on Earth, with approximately 65% of species at risk of extinction. Cycads have many distinctive biological features that can offer significant insights into the evolution of plant function. However, almost nothing is known about their ecology and physiology, making this project critical to understanding the evolution of seed plant function, a story that is as critically endangered as the species themselves. Indeed, lawmakers and conservationists are desperate for tools to save these enigmatic plants from extinction. Thus, this project will provide new insights into one of the earliest examples of land plant seed biology by addressing major gaps in basic aspects of cycad biology, while simultaneously producing transformative data and tools, including those critical to address the urgent threats to cycad survival in South Africa.<br/><br/>This project will address the two greatest human-imposed threats to South African cycad survival, 1) illegal poaching, which is the most significant immediate threat to survival, and 2) a changing climate, which is the greatest threat to long-term survival. The project addresses these threats by using recently developed protocols in forensic isotope ecology, evolutionary physiology, and species distribution modelling. The largest herbarium collection of cycads in Africa at the National Herbarium in South Africa, and one of the most extensive living research collections of cycads in the world, maintained at the Montgomery Botanical Center in Miami, FL will be leveraged for extensive data collections.

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Daniel Blaine Marchant is ""Transcriptional Regulation and Evolution of the Maize Tapetum"". The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Virginia Walbot.<br/><br/>Understanding anther development is fundamental to plant biology from both applied and basic science perspectives. As the source of pollen and male gametes, anthers are a key variable in controlled crop breeding and hybrid seed production. As of yet, the cues and pathways that permit the alternation from a non-reproductive somatic cell to a reproductive germinal cell in plants are poorly understood. The overarching goal of the research is to use maize anthers and state-of-the-art technologies and genetic resources to address questions and provide new insights into the cellular and genetic regulation of anther development and flowering plant reproduction through evolution. Maize is the ideal primary system for this study because each maize plant has separate male and female organ systems, hundreds of developmentally synchronous anthers per plant, and there exists a large collection of male-sterile and female-fertile mutants.  Broader impacts include expanding the organismal and evolutionary knowledge base of plant scientists by training and mentoring of students and  by building a ""Plant Model Systems Living Collection"" in which specimens of the most widely used plant genomics model systems will be housed and maintained at Stanford University. Public access will be enhanced by the availability of learning resources such as web-based manuals providing information on the propagation, natural history and evolution, and anatomy of each species as well as on methods routinely used in plant research such as tissue culture and DNA/RNA extraction.  Training objectives include acquiring expertise with new transcriptomic and genomics methods, and bioinformatics tools. <br/><br/>The de novo differentiation and development of somatic cells into reproductive germ cells is of the upmost importance for plant reproduction as plants do not have established germlines unlike sexual animals. Understanding the genetic cues of the cell layers that regulate sporogenesis in anthers is therefore fundamental to plant biology, but also to agriculture because controlled pollen production underlies hybrid seed production of most crops. Next-generation sequencing and micro-scale RNA isolation have completely altered our knowledge of how anther cell layers differentiate in preparation for meiosis and the cues by which these processes are regulated. This study will expand upon those studies, delving further into the genetic regulation and hierarchies of the cell layers throughout anther sporogenesis with a focus on the tapetum, the cell layer surrounding the germinal cells. State of the art techniques and resources will be implemented to analyze this specific cell layer first in maize, then in taxa across vascular plants. Specific aims include: 1) identifying tapetum-specific and differentially expressed genes and transcription factors across development in wildtype and tapetum-related male-sterile genotypes; 2) developing and implementing two new protocols for investigating the tapetum at the single cell scale to address questions regarding cellular synchroneity within an anther, the precise developmental stages of the tapetum, and sub-cellular localization of transcripts in a comparative techniques framework; and, 3) providing new insights into the evolutionary conservation of the tapetum genetic hierarchy and tapetum-specific genes across vascular plants. The results of this research will be disseminated at the annual International Plant and Animal Genome (PAG) and Maize Genetics Conferences, and through publications in high profile scientific journals. Sequence data will be made publicly available through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and through Gramene and MaizeGDB.

The questions persist in part because modern phylogenetic inference is still deeply influenced by a decades-old paradigm. Data from one or a few genes were typically gathered at the same time, combined into a single dataset, and analyzed by a single program that estimated a shared tree. While the size and complexity of datasets has changed radically in recent years, many aspects of this general workflow pervade. Most current approaches do not naturally integrate inferences from different sources, whether different studies or software packages, and even cutting-edge methods that model differences in gene histories still summarize these histories as a single ""species tree"" topology. More versatile tools are needed to understand the heterogeneity inherent to modern genomic datasets. Key to this versatility is the ability to flexibly and seamlessly move between different stages of a phylogenetic workflow, from inference of individual gene trees to exploration of the genome-wide phylogenetic landscape and, ultimately, to learning about the biological processes that have shaped variation across the genome. Each of these stages may rely on different analytical tools and software.<br/><br/>The major aim of this project is to develop a cyberinfrastructure workflow called Cloudforest to address outstanding challenges in phylogenomics and provide researchers with a set of streamlined tools to explore and understand variation in evolutionary history across different regions of the genome (i.e., gene tree variation). CloudForest will allow users to leverage diverse computing resources that range from laptops, to HPC clusters, to cloud-based resources like JetStream or Amazon Web Services.  CloudForest will meet many of the outstanding needs of empirical phylogenomic studies, such as (1) visualizing variation across gene trees, (2) revealing structure in sets of trees (forests), (3) conducting hypothesis tests regarding the causes of gene-tree variation, and (4) detecting genes that may have outlying (and potentially aberrant) histories. By addressing these challenges in a consistent way across computing platforms, CloudForest will allow biologists to make efficient use of any computational resource at their disposal with workflows appropriate for addressing a variety of important, unresolved questions in both evolutionary biology and other applied fields.  This project also aims to advance broader goals by (1) supporting broad educational and training opportunities for researchers from around the world in the use of advanced computing solutions, (2) actively promoting the involvement and achievements of researchers from underrepresented groups in computational biology, (3) providing unique, interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate students at the intersection of computing, math, and biology, (4) contributing to the development of an interactive and visually rich website for learning about phylogenetics and phylogenomics, and (5) facilitating applied phylogenetic research that will advance human health and well-being.

Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute (HBOI) at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) has a long history of exploring the ocean biodiversity. These efforts have produced a unique collection of specimens designated as the Marine Biotechnology Reference Collection (MBRC). The MBRC is a taxonomically and geographically diverse collection of more than 31,500 preserved benthic marine invertebrates and macroalgae (seaweeds). This collection is unique in that nearly 30% of the samples were selectively collected by the manned Johnson-Sea-Link submersibles at depths of more than 150 m, from locations that are otherwise difficult to access by trawling or dredging due to rugged topography or reef habitats. Collection by submersible means that these specimens are relatively intact compared to those traditionally collected with trawl or dredge. This collection is also unique in that it includes in situ photographs and videotapes.  Collections that were made over a period of 30 years or more provides an opportunity to study changes over time. Research on the specimens, data, images, and videos has already contributed to a better understanding of evolutionary biology, ecology, characterization of marine habitats, and resource management, and has been vital to HBOI's drug discovery program. A goal of this project is to provide the scientific community access to these unique samples and accompanying data. The excellent condition of the specimens makes them useful for molecular analyses, and the videos provide important data to characterize poorly known marine habitats, some of which support commercially and recreationally important fish and invertebrate species.   <br/><br/>An outcome of the project will be a web-accessible version of the collection database, including photos and annotated video clips, for use by researchers, students and the general public worldwide. The collection consists of a complete set of fully digitized dive logs and specimen photographs and thousands of hours of video recordings. Collection data will be verified for accuracy.  Specimens will be barcode labeled for ease in accessing; they are currently organized by collection date in a temperature-controlled environment.  Digitized videotapes will be annotated and linked to the specimen database.  Links to the specimen database will ensure that the complete set of data - specimens, field notes, collection data, photographic images, and videos - can be made publicly available on-line.  Results of this project will be shared and made available to researchers, resource managers, students, and the public through the HBOI-FAU website and through iDigBio.  Digitizing the MBRC and publishing the data on the web will expand the availability and impact of the collection beyond the limitations of an internal, static repository, and will promote teaching, training, and learning in basic and interdisciplinary research in a variety of STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Identifying patterns across the vastly different ecosystems in this endemism hotspot will highlight important areas and plants requiring conservation efforts for future preservation, allowing conservationists to tailor protocols specific to remaining habitats to ensure the well-being of what remains of the mountain ranges? ecosystems, leading to collaborations with conservation organizations and policy makers. The Fellow will also mentor students from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines in scientific investigation as well as creating educational opportunities for K-12 students through summer workshops. <br/><br/>This research will provide insights into factors that formed and maintained habitats with high levels of endemicity, in addition to understanding the role microclimates have on species functional traits across communities. A well-resolved phylogeny will allow us to elucidate the evolutionary history of the vascular plants in this region and determine whether paleo-endemism or neo-endemism led to the current pattern of species richness, in addition to discovering endemism hotspots within the mountain range. Herbarium specimens will be crucial to understanding historical phylogenetic and functional trait diversity across the mountain range. The Fellow will collaborate with the UF Biodiversity Institute and the RISE Precollege Summer Educational Program to organize summer workshops to educate middle and high school students about the anthropogenic impact on our tropical forests. Training goals for the Fellow include learning methods in biological informatics, ecological modeling, and educational outreach including both undergraduate and pre-collegiate teaching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through infection of bacteria, phage can affect carbon and nutrient cycles, influence bacterial diversity, and play important roles in gene transfer. Phage come in two varieties - those with double stranded versus those with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).  It had been assumed that ssDNA phage were not important in aquatic ecosystems, but recent studies by this team suggest otherwise. As the first study of the role of ssDNA phage in inland waters, the proposed research will shed light on a previously overlooked component of aquatic ecosystems. Project results will provide the first insight regarding the abundance, diversity, and ecology of ssDNA phages in natural freshwater habitats. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students, outreach will encourage teenage girls to pursue STEM fields through creating hands-on learning modules for an Oceanography Camp for 8th Grade Girls at the University of South Florida and through involvement with local Girl Scout troops. <br/><br/>This proposal will study the diversity and ecological roles of the ssDNA phages known as gokushoviruses (family Microviridae, subfamily Gokushovirinae) by focusing on two ground-fed springs and associated aquatic ecosystems in Florida. Preliminary studies in one of these springs indicated low ssDNA phage diversity, simplifying evaluations of spatiotemporal variability and improving the likelihood of discriminating specific phage-host associations. This research combines quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze the distribution of gokushoviruses and their potential hosts, as well as lab-based microcosm studies to provide insight into the ecology of this unique viral group. Through diel, daily, and monthly sampling from three sites in each spring system, this project will determine the temporal and spatial patterns of gokushovirus abundance and diversity to test the hypothesis that the springs maintain a stable, low-diversity gokushovirus community, while gokushovirus diversity and abundance display seasonal fluctuations farther from the springs where environmental variation is more pronounced.  Through simultaneous sequence-based analysis of host and phage communities, single-cell techniques, microcosm experiments, measurements of bacterial respiration and metabolic diversity, induction assays, and culturing attempts, this project will constrain the potential host range of gokushoviruses and determine their ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems. These experiments will test the hypothesis that ssDNA phages modify bacterial community composition and ecosystem function through infection of specific bacterial hosts, some of which they are able to lysogenize. Completion of these goals will transform aquatic microbial ecology by enabling the inclusion of ssDNA viruses as a well-understood, integral component of the aquatic virome."

How and why the same genome leads to such enormous diversity of cell types and functions are unanswered questions of modern biology. Yet, cell-specific approaches to link cause and effect are virtually absent for a majority of animal groups. This interdisciplinary project addresses these bottlenecks experimentally by developing novel genomic approaches and chemical labeling tools for genome-wide characterization of expression, classification, and mapping of thousands of individual cells in parallel. This information is used to (i) achieve a nearly complete census of cell types within a given organism, focusing on animal models critical to understanding mechanisms of learning and memory, such as Aplysia, and regeneration, such as Pleurobrachia, and (ii) generate nanoscale probes that selectively mark specific cells for genome editing, regardless of any advance knowledge about the cells' molecular diversity. Several communities are benefiting from the proposed research, including comparative neurobiology, development, biological oceanography, and the emerging field of synthetic biology.  The project also affords cross-disciplinary training opportunities for trainees from the undergraduate to postdoctoral level and educational outreach activities in marine and comparative biology aimed at a diverse K-12 student body. <br/><br/>The grand challenge in our understanding of the genomes-to-phenomes relationships is our general inability to manipulate genome operation at the level of specific individual cells at any given location and at any given time. These obstacles are more dramatic for most invertebrates, when researchers study development or neuronal functions with little information about the cellular composition of target organs. Here, microfluidics for massive parallel single-cell capture and sequencing are integrated with novel cell selection technologies, such as aptamer-based-Cell-SELEX, for quantitative gene expression analyses and imaging of individual cells in intact tissues. Aplysia (and, once single-cell tools are validated, Pleurobrachia and/or related ctenophore species) are used to achieve nearly complete genome-wide classification of the majority of cell types in their neural systems and effector organs. The read-out(s) to measure/control gene expression in identified neurons are: scRNA-seq data with both normalized and absolute quantification of expression levels for target genes, and q-RT-PCR. Controls are neurons in which target genes are not active or silenced. First, unique resources for a diversity of cell adhesion molecules and other surface macromolecular structures critical to design and characterize cell-specific probes are generated. Then, using tools of chemical evolution, a high-throughput system to manufacture cell-specific aptamer-/molecular beacon-based fluorescent probes at a large scale is tested. Finally, hybrid nanoscale probes (e.g. made by coupling cell-specific fluorescent markers with nucleic acid analogues) are tested for their ability to self-deliver molecular constructs into target cells without direct injection, electroporation, or the need to make transgenic animals.

The build-up of this need is often urgent because sleep is crucial to many essential physiological processes including learning, memory formation and tissue repair. The increased sleep need is generated in the brain, presumably by a collection of neurons inter-connected via complex electrical and biochemical signals. This system of connected neurons is collectively known as the sleep homeostat. But despite the homeostat's central role in controlling sleep, very little is known about its structure, composition, and principles of operation. This research will construct a functional architecture of the homeostat by taking advantage of the fruit fly that, like humans, exhibits sleep but, owing to its relative simplicity offers a tractable system in which to dissect the homeostat. The proposed studies will develop a new series of genetic tools that will allow precise and controllable manipulations of the neurons and the interconnecting pathways suspected of forming the sleep homeostat. The experiments will be guided by a novel computational model developed by the PI. Results from the studies will constitute the first computational-molecular model of the sleep homeostat and will likely give rise to new testable hypotheses about the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. The interplay of mathematical modeling and genetics in the project will offer unique opportunities in interdisciplinary research and coursework for undergraduate and graduate students, with particular emphasis on involving members traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.   <br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>This work will establish a model of the sleep homeostat, a feedback system that adjusts future sleep need based on past sleep, which is both mathematically rigorous and molecularly tractable. The project will exploit the fruit fly to build upon a recently developed theoretical model that suggests that four core biochemical pathways constitute the homeostat of the insect. Parameters of the model predict that neuromodulators such as dopamine and short neuropeptide F describe these pathways. A combination of behavioral, genetic and computational approaches will be employed to link the theoretical parameters to the neuromodulators, thus establishing the first quantitative model of the sleep homeostat with well-defined molecular identities. Objective 1 will examine the sleep-wake dynamics over- or under-expressing candidate neuromodulators to rapidly generate a short-list of neuromodulator pathways. Objective 2 will then use the Gal4/UAS system to target the neuromodulator-producing neurons, biochemically perturbing them by altering the abundance of the short-listed substrates. Objective 3 will overexpress ion channels to electrically perturb specific neuromodulator-expressing neurons and serve as a third independent test in the identification of neuromodulators that underlie fly sleep homeostasis. Together, these studies will lead to a unified, computational-molecular model of the homeostat and, in so doing, substantially broaden our understanding of the neural mechanisms governing sleep. Additionally, the computational and molecular approaches taken in the research will be incorporated into laboratory experiences for students, thus training future scientists in how to integrate mathematical and molecular approaches in the study of nervous system functions."

The effort will illuminate the extent to which a reproductive bone structures may be involved in speciation in an ecologically important group of rodents, the squirrels. Such bone structures occur in some of the most diverse groups of mammals and may contribute to speciation via selection processes. Despite decades of scientific curiosity, however, the precise function of these bone structures is unknown in most groups.

Birds exhibit complex behaviors, elaborate physical characteristics, and impressive adaptations, which has made them a major focus of modern scientific research. In current research, birds are a model system for comparative studies on a range of fundamental topics in biology. However, the missing piece of this otherwise powerful comparative biology toolkit is an accurate and complete description of the evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) among all bird species, i.e., an avian tree of life. This project will collect DNA data to fill this gap by producing a complete tree of life for all bird species in order to test hypotheses regarding the origins, diversification, and dispersal of birds around the planet. A complete tree will be transformative to fields like ornithology and evolutionary biology. This project will help prepare the next-generation of biodiversity scientists by training undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral scientists, and also will include numerous public outreach components including exhibits and videos. Developing learning modules and working with teachers will help bring the research into the classroom, reaching a diversity of students in several states.

The accurate duplication of DNA as well as its subsequent transfer from parent to offspring is critical for life. Some environmental factors such as chemical carcinogens, UV light, or even natural cellular processes can cause oxidative or physical damage to our DNA, which can cause mutations or temporarily block its duplication. In fact, it has been estimated that there are tens of thousands of damaged DNA sites (lesions) in each human cell per day. Lesions in genomic DNA of other organisms are also widespread. If left unrepaired, these lesions can inhibit the duplication of DNA, cause cell death, or detrimental mutations. This project will use cutting-edge biophysical techniques to investigate how a commonly occurring oxidative DNA lesion prevents proteins from accurately duplicating the DNA. The results generated from this project will determine the consequences of DNA damage at the molecular level. In addition to its scientific importance, the project will also support undergraduate and graduate students at The Ohio State University with opportunities to receive scientific training, provide them tools for designing and testing scientific hypotheses, as well as learning about the nature of scientific discovery.<br/>  <br/>Cellular DNA is frequently damaged by both endogenous and exogenous sources to form a myriad of DNA damaged sites, which can stall the cellular DNA replication machinery during genome duplication. Some key proteins for DNA replication are the replicative DNA polymerases, which synthesize the majority of DNA, and translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases, which bypass and extend DNA across from damaged DNA sites but often in an error-prone way. The processivity factor PCNA enhances the ability of replicative polymerases to synthesize long stretches of DNA and plays a key role in polymerase switching at sites of DNA damage. It is not known how common DNA lesions affect the conformational dynamics of replicative and TLS polymerases in solution. Furthermore, it is not known how these two different types of polymerases are switched at a lesion site. To study the first mechanistic question, the project will utilize Frster resonance energy transfer techniques and a stopped-flow apparatus, a rapid mixer, to monitor the conformational dynamics of a replicative polymerase and a TLS polymerase during binding to substrates, or PCNA, as well as catalysis. To elucidate molecular details of polymerase switching, this project will employ cutting-edge single molecule techniques to investigate how a replicative polymerase and a TLS polymerase are switched on and off at a DNA damaged site with the help of PCNA.

However, as genetic datasets rapidly grow in size due to technological advances, a number of hurdles arise when trying to estimate such relationships. Though many methods have been developed to address these challenges, one source of error that is not accounted for by available methods is non-random mating in ancient populations. Because individuals generally do not mate randomly, and because population and species relationships are used to answer diverse research questions from basic science to epidemiology, addressing this source of error is critical. The primary goal of this project is to design statistical methods for estimating population and species relationships that account for non-random mating in ancient populations, thereby increasing the accuracy of estimation. Moreover, it is of high priority that both the scientific community and the public are engaged in the advances of this project. To this end, the researchers will make all approaches developed during this project freely available for use by the wider scientific community. Also, the researchers will work with K-12 students in hands-on activities for learning why and how to build population and species relationships through the Penn State Science-U program.

The model organisms considered will be mouse, yeast, and mosquito, for which previous studies have observed skewed gene tree frequencies that were attributed to gene flow through hybridization, but may instead be the result of ancestral structure. The researchers will also apply these methods to a non-model coral system, which is of particular interest because morphological and fossil data provide evidence of hybridization, suggesting that this system may exhibit skewed gene tree frequencies. Application to these systems will serve to elucidate and refine knowledge of the events shaping the evolution of these lineages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Further, individuals alter how much they sleep in response to their environments. While modulating sleep is likely important for an animal's survival, little is known about how this plasticity in sleeping behavior evolves. One ecological factor that affects how much an animal sleeps is food availability. Some species reduce sleep in response to a food-poor environment, presumably to increase the time available for foraging. However, others increase sleep under these conditions, which is likely a strategy to conserve energy when food is not available. This is referred to as sleep plasticity. This work examines the evolution of sleep plasticity using the blind Mexican cavefish as a focal species. By quantifying sleep in cavefish in their natural habitats across seasons, the researchers will connect naturally occurring, variable environmental conditions to the amount animals sleep. Further, sleep plasticity will be examined in crosses derived from cavefish and their surface fish counterparts, allowing for examination of the genetic basis of sleep plasticity. Together, these studies will provide unprecedented insight into how and why sleep plasticity has evolved, how sleep plasticity is impacted by environmental variables, and the underlying genetic influences on sleep plasticity. The captivating cavefish system will be leveraged to engage students through the development of a research-intensive course for undergraduates and a summer research mentoring program for high school students. Finally, a collaboration with FAU's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute will promote understanding of scientific research for retired citizens and provide research opportunities for local retirees.<br/><br/>Organisms regulate sleep in response to environmental factors, displaying sleep plasticity.  One striking example of sleep plasticity is the change in sleep observed under different nutrient availability conditions. This project aims to understand the genetic basis of the evolution of sleep plasticity in the Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. Cavefish sleep less than conspecific surface fish under ad libitum fed laboratory conditions. When starved, surface and cavefish have opposite responses: surface fish reduce sleep whereas cavefish increase sleep. This research program will test the hypothesis that cavefish have evolved sleep loss and altered sleep plasticity in response to a cave environment that strongly varies in food availability across seasons. The relationship between sleep plasticity and evolution in a variable environment are examined using three approaches: 1) surface-cave hybrids and cave-cave hybrids generated from multiple cave populations will be evaluated to elucidate the genetic architecture underlying sleep plasticity and to identify candidate genes for the evolution of this trait, 2) sleep, feeding, and food availability will be measured in the field across seasons in three different cavefish-containing caves to define these behaviors in natural habitats, and to determine the environmental conditions under which these behaviors have evolved, and 3) genomic and behavioral analyses will be performed on fish from different pools within the same cave that vary in food availability to uncover the genetic underpinnings of behavioral evolution within a single cave.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of this knowledge comes from the scientific collections accumulated over centuries.  These large collections in turn are partly an amalgam of many smaller ones, made and donated by research institutions and naturalists that no longer have the capacity to care for them or make them available to users.  The goal of this project is to provide for the long-term care and accessibility of three important collections received by the Florida Museum. About 67,000 specimen lots (each ""lot"" contains one or more specimens) representing more than 300,000 specimens of diverse marine organisms will be archivally rehoused, and made available online, through loans, and to visitors.  The Florida Museum invertebrate collection (FLMNH-IZ) will be expanded with new shelving and cabinetry to accommodate recent growth.  A cadre of undergraduate students will help to carry out this work, as they also learn about marine life, biodiversity, and museum science in short courses organized as part of the project.<br/><br/>The project will provide new shelf and cabinet space for the greatly increased at FLMNH-IZ. The collection has doubled in size in 15 years as a result of an active field program, and rescue and curation of valuable relinquished collections. The FLMNH-IZ is a major research node for studies on mollusks and tropical marine invertebrates. It serves the third largest collection of specimen-data on non-insect invertebrates in the world and is used broadly by the research community. The collection averages 35-40 visitors, 75-80 loans, and is the basis of 40-50 publications a year. The project will also allow the curation of three high-quality relinquished collections. The Harry Lee collection is perhaps the most important private shell collection in the US and includes specimens of 12,000 identified species.  The Maturo and McKinney Bryozoa collections are among the largest in the country of the poorly known but highly diverse ""moss animals"".  The NOAA-NCRMP collection is an alcohol-fixed, wet collection of reef invertebrates holding several thousand species taken from 26 islands across the tropical Pacific over the past decade, including from several remote, uninhabited, and virtually unknown islands. It offers a wealth of material for systematic and molecular genetic studies of Pacific biodiversity.  These collections will be available physically and online, through resources such as iDigBio (idigbio.org) together with the more than 600,000 specimen records already digitized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microbes can help or hurt the plants they live with. For example, some microbes help plants grow in places without many nutrients, while other microbes cause disease. Given humanity's dependence on plants for food, shelter, clear air and fuel, understanding how microbes affect plant health is important, especially as the environment changes. This research will test how soil microbes help or hurt individual plants and how they may determine where groups of plants are found together. The goal is to see if microbes act as ""hidden players"" that explain patterns long thought to be explained by other things. Understanding microbial effects on plants can also improve how rare plants are managed and conserved, which is relevant because this project will take place in an area with many rare species. The project will provide training in field research for the next generation of scientists, including students from underrepresented groups at the University of Miami. Researchers will work with public school teachers to create nature documentaries and teaching modules to help middle school students learn about the hidden but important role of microbes in the world around them. <br/> <br/>This project has three main components. The first is to examine the interaction between well-known selection pressures (fire and allelopathy) and soil microbes on individual plant fitness. Next-generation sequencing will be used to determine how the soil microbiome responds to fire and allelopathy. Then, greenhouse experiments will be used to disentangle the role of differences in the soil microbes from differences in soil properties (and the interaction between the two) in governing plant fitness. The second component of the project will combine bioassays determining the effect of soil microbes on plant demographic parameters with existing long-term datasets to examine the demographic pathways and ecological contexts that allow microbes to influence plant population and metapopulation dynamics. This approach will use integral projection modeling to integrate microbial effects and patch-specific environmental parameters to understand the mechanistic basis for the distribution of 11 plant species across a patchy landscape. The final component will incorporate next-generation sequencing of soil microbiomes from ~700 sites into plant species distribution models to examine the relative importance of microbial and abiotic factors in determining the distributions of all ~80 members of the local plant community. Taken together, these new applications of modeling species distributions, demography, and metapopulations, parameterized with data from long-term studies and experiments, will shed light on the important linkages between plant distributions and their microbial associates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientists have wondered for a long time why some are so rare and others so common. Perhaps some are better at protecting themselves from insects and diseases. These species could then become unusually common. How do plants protect themselves?  Most make special chemicals that can be a potent defense against natural enemies (mostly fungus and insects). Scientists think such chemicals may be especially important in very common species because without extra protection, insects and fungal diseases would spread rapidly in dense populations. This project will test whether plant chemicals can explain how the most common rainforest trees keep from being overwhelmed by their enemies. More generally, it may explain the abundance of different species in different places. This study will also test the role of plant chemicals as defenses against soil pathogens, which are important but poorly known. Data from this project has the potential to generate new medical and agricultural applications. The project will engage and involve low income, first-generation high school students and undergraduates at three universities. Finally, students at those universities will gain essential skills by attending a tropical field biology course with students from Peru and Brazil, and will learn how to do rainforest research. <br/><br/>This project will focus on Protium (Burseraceae), a common and diverse genus of Neotropical trees. Protium species with more diverse and effective anti-enemy defenses are hypothesized to suffer less density-dependent mortality, gaining a strong competitive advantage that should translate into larger populations at the local and regional scale. In the laboratory, metabolomic approaches will assess the diversity of plant secondary metabolites in leaves and roots of Protium in tandem with DNA sequencing to identify how those metabolites influence the presence of fungal pathogens, thus elucidating their role in mediating plant-natural enemy interactions. In the field, a combination of observational and experimental approaches will identify these plant-defense-enemy interactions and quantify their effect on host plant species abundances and the ability of locally and regionally abundant taxa to escape negative density-dependent interactions. This experimental component will be conducted in forest reserves in Iquitos, Peru where permanent plots by long-term collaborators and international institutional partners have been established through previous NSF projects. To investigate how chemical diversity might affect large scale patterns of species abundances in the Amazon basin, this project will also perform systematic surveys across large areas in Peru, Colombia and Brazil to determine how chemistry and plant natural enemy communities change across species? ranges. Results will provide a critical test of specific chemically-mediated mechanisms thought to control plant-natural enemy interactions, and thus a newly emerging hypothesis about the ecological processes that determine rarity and commonness in high diversity tropical rainforests. Ultimately, this research will yield a deeper understanding of the processes underlying the origin and maintenance of the vast biodiversity of tropical forests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This leads to delays and increase in costs of development of new varieties that are more productive, disease resistant and tolerant to environmental stresses.  In the case of forestry, this wait can be decades-long, thus hampering tree improvement for the timber, paper and bioenergy industries.  Development of new cultivars could be accelerated if there was a way to tell what useful traits a plant would have based on its DNA alone.  The ability to use DNA to predict the traits of a grown plant, from its development to its productivity, remains one of the recognized grand challenges of plant biology. Even more relevant and incomplete is the understanding of the chain of events that lead from DNA to trait. A complete understanding of a plant's biological system will allow the identification of the key regulatory points that impact its traits of economic importance, while also allowing their prediction. In this project novel approaches will be developed to predict the development and the growth properties of plants, and their immediate regulators. These approaches will integrate information beyond DNA to include gene expression data, and create a more complete description and prediction of trait regulation. Tools developed here will be disseminated to the community by the release of analysis software packages, and workshops will be conducted to enhance teaching of quantitative genetics and statistical methods in predictive models to the scientific community. The project incorporates a training component focused on high-school teachers and students. High-school teachers will join the investigator laboratories to learn about real-world applications of genomics and develop curriculum with support of the University of Florida Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET). Students from underrepresented groups will be trained in science through CPET's Student Science Training Program. The proposed research will also provide ample opportunities to train graduate students at the intersection between quantitative and statistical genetics, and genomics. <br/><br/>Genomic prediction of complex traits is a critical tool in animal and plant breeding. However, the ability to fully explain a phenotypic trait is still limited, in part because several dimensions of information are either not available or not incorporated to prediction models. In this project, genome sequence information will be used initially to predict gene expression, and gene expression of the ensemble of genes will be applied to predict whole-plant phenotypes. As a last step, genome sequence and transcriptome data will be integrated for prediction of phenotypes and their regulators. Thus, a model for prediction that incorporates multiple layers of information will serve as a tool for prediction of plant molecular properties (e.g. gene expression), as well as growth and developmental traits. This project will make use of a large Populus deltoides association population for which abundant genome, transcriptome and phenotypic resources are already available or will be developed here. Prediction tools will also be applicable to other species for which similar type of resources are available. The research methods to be applied to each aim will consist of four components: (1) detection of large-effect factors (e.g., individual or groups of variants with large regulatory effects) using single-factor regression methods, (2) development of prediction models that combine whole-genome information from large and small-effect factors, (3) biological validation of findings using genetic modification, and (4) statistical validation using an independent population. Genotypic and gene expression data will be publically available in NCBI's dbSNP and the sequence read archive/gene expression omnibus databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Analysis packages will be deposited in the R Archive (http://cran.r-project.org/), and project details and plant resource access procedures will be described in the project web site (http://sfrc.ufl.edu/forestgenomics/Kirstlab/)."

This project leverages this opportunity, and the research team's previous work in the area, to understand how coral existing genetic variation interacts with acquired environmental modifications (i.e., microbiome and epigenome) during intra- and trans-generational responses to extreme climatic events. For this purpose, coral and Symbiodinium genotypes, bacterial diversity and epigenomic modifications will be directly examined, exploring their role in coral demographic and physiological recovery and the inheritance of epigenomic signatures linked to stress acclimatization. This work will be accomplished by a multi-institutional team, providing much needed answers to questions concerning the mechanisms by which foundational species acclimatize to rapidly changing environmental conditions. By better understanding the mechanisms contributing to stress responses, the researchers hope to learn how long lived sessile organisms may adapt or acclimatize to a extreme events. Established resources at Florida International University, the University of Puerto Rico, and Pennsylvania State University will be used to recruit and engage graduate and undergraduate students from under-represented groups in science in the research. The research team will work closely with Puerto Rican agencies and local resource managers to communicate management and conservation applications from the research. <br/><br/>The increasing frequency and intensity of altered storm regimes will contribute to significantly reducing coral population sizes in the next few decades. While it is known that environmentally acquired modifications can influence coral health and physiology, their precise role and interaction with coral existing genetic variation to promote phenotypic plasticity remain one of the central gaps in our understanding of metazoan ecology and evolution. This project will be the first investigation into the interaction between coral genetic variation and two different types of environmentally acquired modifications (epigenome and microbiome) during intra- and trans-generational responses to high-energy storms. The proposed research will determine a) if modifications in epigenetic signatures and bacterial diversity are dependent on specific associations between coral host and Symbiodinium genotypes, b) if those modifications promote differential physiological and demographic performance during post-hurricane recovery, and c) if epigenomic modifications acquired by progenitors are transmitted to their offspring. Two graduate students and 2 REU undergraduates will be engaged in this research. The research team will work closely with Puerto Rico agencies, convene monthly conference calls, and provide regular updates about this work to local resource managers. A formal evaluation protocol will be used to assess implementation and progress of the proposed educational and scientific activities (following NSF user-friendly handbook for project evaluation).

Understanding evolution is essential for figuring out solutions to modern problems such as antibiotic resistance, a major problem in medicine, and for understanding how life on our planet became so diverse and how it will change next. Animal weapons including such intriguing structures as horns on bighorn sheep, antlers on deer, and tusks on elephants, have fascinated people for centuries. The earliest-known human paintings show wild animals fighting with weapons. In spite of the interest these structures have attracted, understanding of weapon diversity is in its infancy. This project will increase understanding of why even closely-related species can have profoundly different weapons. Simultaneously, it will provide important insights into why other shapes and forms in nature can be so variable. Data and specimens collected as part of this project will be stored in scientific archives and museums, where they will be shared freely with other researchers for use in future projects. This project will also contribute directly to the science education of more than two hundred college students. These students will learn how to do science and to recognize that science is a process, not just a collection of facts. The researchers will also interact and share their results with the general public through blogs, presentations, and student-made videos about experiences doing science.<br/><br/>The diverse traits resulting from sexual selection offer outstanding opportunities for understanding the evolutionary interactions between behavior and morphology. It is now well established that mate choice and male-male competition can select for differences in the sizes of ornaments and weapons. However the evolution of the shape of these traits is more puzzling. Why has such shape diversity evolved? In the case of animal weapons, habitat-driven changes in male-male competitive behavior are hypothesized to be a central factor. However, explicit tests of this hypothesis are virtually nonexistent. This project will examine the roles of fighting behavior, ecology, and function in the evolution of weapon shape, capitalizing on the extreme weapon shape diversity and myriad of fighting styles in leaf-footed bugs (Hemiptera: Coreidae) to address the long-standing puzzle of weapon shape diversity. Methods include experimental selection analyses, finite element analysis, phylogenetics, and ancestral state reconstructions. The successful completion of this project will offer an unprecedented analysis of the evolutionary interplay between behavior and morphology, using the medium of weaponry. Data and specimens will be stored and shared with other scientists through international archives, including NCBI, DRYAD, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. Over 200 undergraduates will contribute to the completion of this project through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE), and curricular materials developed for this purpose will be shared with other educators through workshops and publications. Training in the integration of research and education will also be provided to a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates. Substantial outreach will be accomplished through the production of short videos by students, blogs, research spotlights, social media, and public presentations."

The molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions, and the genetic basis for variation in these interactions, are not fully understood. This project focuses on understanding host-parasite interactions in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum to gain improved understanding of fundamental host-parasite interactions. The investigator has linked some host genetic variation with variation in the number of parasite life stages in the host, indicating variable immunity among individual insect hosts and therefore potentially differential ability to transmit the parasite. This researcher has developed a novel, computational approach to identify additional host genes associated with parasite infection, which enables the investigation of such genetic variation in immunity to parasites in natural populations of An. Gambiae, which can be more informative than studies in laboratory populations. The investigator will employ modern genomic, biochemical and computational methods in this study. This project will improve our knowledge base about the genetic basis of, and the molecular mechanisms of insect innate immunity against parasites, and more generally host-parasite interactions. An important broader scientific and societal impact of this study is improved understanding of the specific mosquito-parasite system that causes the disease malaria, which causes suffering and death in millions of people each year.<br/><br/>Genetic analyses have demonstrated that genetic variation in Anopheles gambiae is associated with the number of Plasmodium oocysts in mosquitoes. Identifying the genes associated with variation in infection intensity and understanding how they function are important in decoding the genetic and molecular basis of insect-parasite interaction. Targeting these genes will lead to novel approaches in controlling parasite transmission. However, it is difficult to determine causative mutations from ~300 million base pairs and ~15,000 genes in the mosquito genome using traditional approaches. In a recent, significant finding, the Principal Investigator and co-workers used a novel computational approach and identified approximately 1% of the An. gambiae genome that is enriched with genes related to P. falciparum infection in mosquitoes. This research project is aimed at analysis of these newly identified genomic regions to elucidate molecular mechanisms of insect-parasite interaction using the well-characterized An. gambiae populations and P. falciparum parasites from western Kenya. Direct association studies will be systematically conducted to detect genetic variations associated with P. falciparum infection intensity in wild A. gambiae populations from Africa. Then the relative role of the candidate mosquito genes on parasite invasion will be determined under laboratory conditions and in the wild in Africa. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of candidate genes will be investigated. The combination of computational approaches, molecular functional analyses in the laboratory, and field entomology studies is a very powerful set of tools to address insect-parasite interactions. This CAREER project will integrate research and education from K-12 to graduate students, locally, nationally and internationally. K-12 students and teachers will have opportunities to learn and participate in genomics research with the investigators in this study. Seminars on insect-parasite interactions will be provided in local schools and universities. The educational seminars will also be given to the communities in Kenya where P. falciparum infection is endemic. While undergraduate and graduate students play important roles in the research, the research program also provides materials and resources for education in classrooms. Ultimately, an outstanding research program coupled with an excellent genomics curriculum will be established."

For example, every time a tennis player returns a serve, conditions are different from those the player has experienced in the past: the ball is travelling at a slightly different speed, or at a different angle, or with a different rotation. Yet, the nervous system is able to generate a response that is effective under these novel conditions. How is this possible? This project will address this question by combining new mathematical methods with a novel experimental system that uses real-time computer vision to track animals as they solve sequential decision tasks. As part of the broader impacts of the study, the investigators will partner with an undergraduate education program intended to introduce research opportunities to traditionally underrepresented STEM students. Interdisciplinary teams of students will be mentored in developing and executing small research projects related to the theme of the larger project with the goal providing a gateway for both basic science majors, and also engineering and mathematics majors into cutting-edge, interdisciplinary science. In addition, the investigators will incorporate this research when mentoring participants in the University of Florida's longstanding Whitney Lab REU program (31 years). The results of this work will shed light on how animals generate such a diverse range of behaviors to survive in novel situations, and will lead to new questions and approaches that can be used to understand the function of the vertebrate nervous system and the origins of behavioral control in some of the most important tasks animals undertake.<br/><br/>Unlike binary choice tasks, which have long served as the model for animal decision-making, more complex sensory-motor behaviors such as avoiding predators or capturing prey often involve sequences of decisions made in response to dynamic streams of sensory stimuli. A key requirement of such behaviors is that they be robust. For example, the exact chain of decisions required to escape a predator will differ from one setting to another, yet an animal must generate a sequence of responses uniquely suited to the situation at hand. This highlights a perennial question about animal behavior: how can behaviors that are learned or evolved in one context generalize to the enormous set of possible situations an animal might encounter? This project attacks this question using a combination of mathematical modeling and high-resolution, closed loop experiments using the prey attack and predator evasion behaviors of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a model for studying how animals generate flexible, robust behavioral sequences. In particular, the investigators will test the emerging hypothesis that these robust, higher-level behavioral responses are achieved through a mechanism called behavioral gain control. Research will explore how behavioral gain control is involved in initiating behavioral sequences at the right time, balancing multiple competing objectives, coordinating control along multiple behavioral dimensions (e.g., acceleration, turning), and maintaining performance across changing environmental conditions. This work has the potential to shed new light on how complex behaviors are generated in the context of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sleep duration varies greatly between individuals, but little is known about how variation in brain chemistry may underlie differences in sleep need. To learn more about how brain chemistry affects sleep need, a group of fish that have lost the need to sleep during their evolution are being studied. Mexican cavefish were trapped in caves millions of years ago, and have since adapted to these nutrient-poor environments by dramatically reducing sleep, though we do not yet know what changes in the brain make that possible. Work in this project tests if changes in sleep need are associated with alterations sensory processes that promote the production of a chemical called Orexin. Orexin production in the brain is being compared between cavefish and related, river-dwelling surface fish with regular sleep patterns, and the ability of drugs that influence Orexin to alter sleep in cavefish is also being examined. Determining the chemical basis for sleep loss in Mexican cavefish will enable us to better understand how the brain normally regulates sleep, as well as how changes in brain chemistry, across evolutionary time or day-to-day in animals that need sleep, affect this critical life function and an animal's well-being. Numerous undergraduates from diverse racial and socioeconomic groups will participate in this work, as well as in developing community outreach programs that will use enhance scientific literacy in the public at large and in senior citizen communities in particular.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Sleep is a nearly ubiquitous behavior throughout the animal kingdom, yet little is known about the functional and evolutionary principles driving sleep differences between species or individuals within a population. The Mexican cavefish Astyanax mexicanus, exists as independent populations of an ancestral eyed surface morph and blind cave morphs of the same species. The convergent evolution of sleep loss in multiple independent A. mexicanus cave populations provides the unique opportunity to examine the role of ecology and evolutionary history in shaping sleep. This research program will determine whether sensory input through the lateral line directly modulates function of the wake-promoting neuropeptide Orexin and the contributions of changes in Orexin neuroanatomy to the evolution of sleep loss in cave populations. Work produced in this project will contribute to our understanding of the biological basis of sleep with potential extension to a better understanding of the mechanistic basis of naturally occurring sleep differences in humans. In addition to contributing to scientific knowledge across life disciplines, this project will provide opportunities for student training and outreach in the local community. Teaching tools will be developed in collaboration with a local high school to expose students to behavioral ecology and neuroscience research. All developed lab protocols will be made available online for access and use at other high schools and teaching institutions. Additionally, this project will fund students enrolled in programs for first generation and minority college students to work in the research laboratory."
