As one of the five senses, smell plays a large role in how insects and other animals interact with plants, including whether a plant is pollinated or eaten.  Because one-third of the calories that humans eat come from plants that are pollinated by animals, a basic understanding of pollination is important to food security.  More broadly, smell, for reasons related to immune systems, affects how animals recognize relatives, choose mates, remember events and attach emotional value to them. Recent breakthroughs allow the use of a GC-Mass Spec to detect very small amounts of chemicals emitted into the air.  Currently deployed equipment has primarily been confined to artificial, laboratory settings.  This project will provide students and scientists from across the United States an opportunity to study the role of chemicals in mediating the relationships between plants and animals in a natural, field setting. Specific research projects will include exploring how the simultaneous pressures of avoiding being eaten while attracting pollinators affect the evolution of plants, the manner in which chemicals affect where insects eat plants, as well as shed light into the evolutionary pathways by which insects began to use plants as food.  RMBL will provide training to scientists and students on how to use the equipment, reaching diverse cultural groups through our education programs, which have a high minority participation rate.<br/><br/>This project will install a state-of-the-art Shimadzu Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) 2010 Ultra, with both thermal desorption and conventional solvent-desorption injection ports, at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory.  Taking advantage of recent technological improvements, this equipment will allow the identification of volatile chemicals emitted by plants in an ecological context.  This project will provide the first such instrument to users at a major research field station in the US and will enhance scientific infrastructure by improving access to instrumentation on a cost effective basis.  In addition to supporting research by scores of scientists from around the world, Co-PI's Diane Campbell (UC-Irvine) and Robert Raguso (Cornell) will incorporate floral volatiles (e.g., indole and á-pinene) into studies of how interactions with pollinators and seed predators influence natural selection on floral trait combinations.  Emily Mooney (Univ. of CO, Colorado Springs) and Kailen Mooney (UC-Irvine) will build upon past and ongoing studies of the interactions between the herbaceous host plant Ligusticum porteri, the aphid Aphis helianthi, its locally dominant insect herbivore, and the predators and ants that attack and protect the aphid, respectively.  As part of his work on the evolutionary genomic architecture underlying herbivory, Noah Whiteman (UC-Berkeley) will identify volatiles from Cardamine cordifolia in order to design experiments to expose Scaptomyza nigrita flies to active compounds in behavior trials.  Additionally, RMBL will offer training in chemical analysis, including a one-week course for novices and a course for those who have experience with GC-MS but not the particular model machine.  We will integrate the equipment in training of a diverse scientific workforce.  More than 38% of participants in our Research Experience for Undergraduate program are minorities. We anticipate that some of these students will learn to analyze chromatograms, extending their skill sets beyond biology and thereby enhancing future career opportunities.

Correlations between the state of the soil and the contents of the major water-conducting tissue in plants, the xylem, are well-established. Xylem contents will be analyzed in ""interrogator plants"" by implanting bioelectronic sensors in plant stems, inducing xylem to form around them and remotely communicating data from these sensors by low-power radio transmission.  This approach will avoid the complexity of sensing the soil directly by instead detecting the chemical response of vascular fluids to chemical and biological changes in the soil around the roots. These fluids, which are transported by the woody xylem tissues, are under negative pressure and thus typically difficult to access.  The project will therefore investigate a number of regeneration techniques for surgically implanted, small sensors such that these sensors become associated with xylem tissue in graft junctions, much like the grafting currently used routinely in fruit trees.  The entire small sensor including implanted electronics and regenerative coating will be screen-printed for very low cost.  Screen printing recipes and other enabling techniques will be shared with the public through the Open Science Framework.  Public use of these results will be further fostered by funded kits distributed to teams through the international BioMaker and OpenPlant programs.<br/><br/>The research will explore the new field of phytoelectronics, the convergence of botany for biorecognition, bioelectronics for chemo-sensing, internet-of-things (IoT) electronics for communication, and machine-learning for classification.  The goals of the research are to 1) create an inexpensive, potentially biodegradable platform for multi-variate sensing of the soil utilizing the inherent robustness of living plants to operate autonomously in variable conditions; 2) merge these plants with the IoT in which buried roots extract and communicate soil state chemically to embedded multi-analyte, electronic sensors that then digitize and relay these data to servers for integration and machine learning; and 3) advance understanding of the interaction of soil and the biosphere by selecting plants specialized for specific chemical, pathogen or ecological signals and using them as instruments.  The team will accomplish these goals by 1) printing the multi-analyte sensors based on arrays of organic electrochemical transistors individually functionalized with ion specific membranes, 2) creating printable drug-release coatings for the electronics that encourage regeneration of xylem tissue near the surgically implanted sensor, and 3) connecting these ""chipped plants"" to RFID or LoRA backscatter communication tags which are interrogated remotely to retrieve digitized sensor response.  At program end, the combination of these studies should enable the soil nitrate concentration in a cornfield to be monitored daily with resolution down to square meters.<br/><br/>This project was awarded through the ""Signals in the Soil (SitS)opportunity, a collaborative solicitation that involves the ENG/CBET and BIO/IOS divisions of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) and the following United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) research councils: 1) The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), 2) the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  (BBSRC), 3) the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Educational components situated at the intersection of STEM fields, social sciences, and rhetoric will engage a broad cohort of students discussing pressing issues in ethics and governance and the themes that shape scientific inquiry. Outreach will involve production of new media accessible to non-experts paired with in-depth written companion articles.<br/><br/>Most theories of the origins-of-life posit an RNA world of self-replicating RNA molecules, followed by an RNA/protein world and possibly RNA-based protocells, and leading to present-day cells where RNA has been replaced by DNA as the information source. The transition from RNA to DNA is crucial, yet little is known about the constraints of RNA as a cellular genome. Although RNA-based cells no longer exist on Earth, RNA viruses may be remnants of pre-DNA life, and RNA life may exist elsewhere in the universe. This research will create new enabling technologies to launch artificial RNA chromosomes (ARCs) in bacterial and eukaryotic cells, characterize the physical stability of ARCs inside these hosts, measure the fidelity of information transmission to daughter cells, and finally provide evidence for the information capacity of RNA-based genomes. The ultimate goals are to establish ARCs as essential chromosomes within E. coli and S. cerevisiae (yeast) hosts. These cells would represent new forms of artificial life, which along with other novel and radically modified organisms (N/RMOs) are of great public interest.

Salinization of freshwater ecosystems has been identified as an important global threat to ecosystem goods and services. Yet very little is known about how increased salinity will impact freshwater communities and ecosystems. The proposed research will contribute a mechanistic understanding on how salinity alters suites of physiological and behavioral traits and how these changes in turn shape geographic distributions and fish community structure. The proposed research also includes an educational outreach component focused on middle school students. Live fish will be used in classrooms to teach students biological concepts through inquiry-based approaches. Assessments of a pilot program have shown improved student understanding of biological concepts and increased test scores.<br/><br/>All species in nature show a limited geographical distribution. Indeed, one of the most fundamental goals of ecological and physiological research is to explain why some organisms occur in some environments and not others. Geographic range limits also pose a fundamental evolutionary question; why don't populations evolve over time to occupy a wider range of environments. Such simple questions remain largely unanswered for most organisms, limiting our ability to predict how organisms respond to environmental variation.  The challenge persists in part because the causes of geographic range limits requires an understanding of how multiple abiotic and biotic factors covary in the environment, and how suites of different traits respond and adapt to these challenges. In the research proposed here, the distributional limits of closely related tropical fish species in the genus Poecilia are investigated. When these fish occur together they segregate along a salinity gradient, but when they occur alone they span a broad range of salinities, suggesting salinity tolerance and competitive interactions jointly shape distributional limits and community structure. The proposed research focuses on how osmoregulation, behavioral aggression, hormones, metabolic scope, and locomotor performance interact with each other. These traits are typically studied separately, however, their joint study reveals new hypotheses on how shared mechanisms can influence multiple traits in ways that lead to geographic range limits. The proposed research will use lab and field experiments to first test 1) how elevated energetic costs of salinity stress, interspecific competition, and predation pressure may make some environments too expensive to persist in, and 2) how hormonal changes associated with osmoregulation may compromise competitive ability and food acquisition. Second, the proposed research will explore the role of gene flow, additive genetic variation, and negative genetic correlations as evolutionary constraints on osmoregulation and competitive ability using a combination of lab breeding experiments, genomic approaches, and artificial selection experiments. Collectively, the proposed research not only offers an opportunity to test the eco-physiological and evolutionary causes of geographic range limits, but also provides an integrative framework that can be applied more broadly."

It is impossible to deduce the functions of these networks using intuitive reasoning alone. Therefore, scientists construct mathematical models of cellular processes that can be simulated in the computer. Unfortunately, it takes many years of careful study of the scientific literature and steady, incremental progress to construct detailed, comprehensive, and accurate mathematical models. This project will create an integrated computational - experimental framework that will significantly accelerate the process of mathematical modeling. The project will create several scientific innovations including (a) novel approaches to searching the space of model simulations to identify promising predictions, (b) computational techniques to efficiently plan experiments, (c) experimental methods that use these plans to rapidly test model predictions, and (d) automatic techniques to extend and refine the models to accommodate the results of these experiments. The project will benefit science by applying this framework to develop a comprehensive, new model that describes how nutrients control the growth of baker's yeast cells. Long term benefits to society will accrue from the use of the methods developed by this project to study any complex cellular system, e.g., those implicated in cell proliferation in cancers, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. <br/><br/>Computational cell biologists have constructed detailed, mechanistic, and predictive mathematical models of many physiological processes in living cells. In principle, such models can predict the phenotypes of novel combinations of gene mutations. However, this potential has not been fully realized for three reasons: (a) the number of possible combinations grows explosively, complicating the search and prioritization of informative mutants, (b) it is impossible to manually plan experiments to make and characterize thousands of mutants, and (c) automated techniques that can resolve contradictions between experimental results and model predictions are still under development. The goal of this project is to create a unique, integrated framework that will address these challenges by (a) systematically generating informative predictions from mathematical models, (b) computationally synthesizing high-throughput experimental plans to test these predictions, and (c) rapidly reconciling inconsistencies between model and experiment. The project will apply this framework to models of cell growth and division in budding yeast. This transformative approach will streamline and accelerate the mathematical modeling cycle. The computational approaches developed for synthesizing experimental plans will be broadly applicable to other organisms, including mammalian cells, that can be systematically perturbed using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9. Because nutrient conditions, metabolic fluxes, energy budgets, protein synthesis, and cell cycle regulation are central to wound healing and tissue regeneration, to the engineering of artificial tissues and organs, and to the expansion and spread of tumors, the methods and models we develop here in the context of budding yeast cell biology will be of great relevance to mammalian biology. The educational component of our project will infuse computational thinking into biology at the undergraduate level and encourage students with backgrounds in life science, engineering, or computation to consider systems biology as a career choice. The project will offer a 10-week summer research institute on 'Computationally - Driven Experimental Biology' to six undergraduate students, consisting of lectures on project -related topics and a single collaborative research project. Involving all the students in a single research project will expose them to team science and give them an appreciation of how computer science, mathematics, and experimental cell biology can be seamlessly interwoven to study cellular processes.

Kinetic tremors, where the limb oscillates around a target, result from cerebellar damage and resemble the behavior of feedback error-driven control systems, where slow sensory feedback results in the limb repeatedly over- and under-shooting its target. This deficit suggests that the cerebellum normally computes a 'forward model', i.e. a prediction of body kinematics, bypassing slow sensory feedback to guide movement. Physiological measurements support this model, where Purkinje neuron activity correlates perfectly with movement kinematics, yet the utility of this encoding is obscure at the level of the cerebellar nuclei, which form the sole output of the cerebellum. This proposal advances the hypothesis that the forward kinematic model of Purkinje neurons is refined in the cerebellar nuclei via convergence with a previously unrecognized corollary discharge afferent that exclusively targets the nuclei. The experiments proposed will test this hypothesis using a novel closed-loop reach paradigm in mice with awake-behaving neural recordings and neuronal branch-specific optogenetic manipulations.

Most research into hybrid disadvantage has focused on hybrid sterility or embryonic developmental problems. However, reductions in cognitive abilities such as learning and memory could also cause disadvantages for hybrids. Learning and memory are important for many species, but whether deficits in hybrids' learning and memory can function in keeping species separate is unknown. This collaborative project will evaluate the possibility that learning and memory deficiencies maintain the species boundary between hybridizing chickadee species. This work will fill an important void in our understanding of the development and maintenance of species, a fundamental evolutionary process. It will inspire new avenues of research in evolution, behavior, and neuroscience. The research also has important implications for the conservation of biodiversity. With this project, the researchers will train postdoctoral and graduate students. Additionally, underrepresented undergraduate students will gain integrative training in research and science communication. Students involved in mentored research at each institution during the academic year will work on a different aspect of the project at one of the other involved institutions during the summer. As a part of the summer experience, the students will collaborate with the Bird Academy at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to develop a high-traffic online module on bird hybridization. They will therefore learn to employ diverse research approaches to address a common question, and to communicate science to the public. <br/><br/>How learning and memory function in hybrids is relatively unexplored. These traits have been shaped by natural selection, but their role in the maintenance of species boundaries is unknown. The overall objective of the proposed research is to integrate behavior with neuroanatomy and genomics to evaluate the potential for hybrid deficiencies in cognitive ability to contribute to postzygotic reproductive isolation. Using naturally-hybridizing black-capped and Carolina chickadees, the proposed research will test the central hypothesis that selection acts against hybrids deficient in memory and learning, and that these deficiencies are reflected in neuroanatomic and genomic variation. This system is well suited for testing the role of cognition in postzygotic reproductive isolation because learning and memory are important for fitness in both species. Preliminary data suggest that hybrid chickadees have deficient memories and small hippocampal neurons, and that genes linked to learning and memory are involved in reproductive isolation. The research team will address the central hypothesis in an eastern Pennsylvania hybrid zone transect. With behavioral tests of learning and memory, comparative neuroanatomy, RNA sequencing, and whole-genome resequencing, the research will: 1) determine the relative learning and memory abilities of black-capped, Carolina, and hybrid chickadees; 2) quantify neuroanatomic differences between hybrid and parental-species chickadees; and 3) identify signatures of reproductive isolation and misexpression in genes underlying cognition. Through the completion and integration of these aims, this research will connect cognition with speciation in the first test of hybrid learning and memory deficiency as a postzygotic reproductive isolating barrier.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To help ensure a scientifically literate society that is prepared to deal with these issues, it is thus in the national interest to develop effective methods of teaching biological concepts. To that end, collaborations between scientists in discipline-based education research in biology (DBER-BIO) and learning sciences (LS; including cognitive, educational, and developmental psychology) have resulted in new theories and pedagogical strategies that advance understanding of learning in biology. Despite the benefits, however, these partnerships are relatively uncommon. Although the DBER-BIO and LS communities share the goal of understanding learning, connecting the two groups is often hindered by differences in training, methodologies, and practices. To facilitate collaboration between DBER-BIO and LS, the PI team will host a one-day workshop. The goals of the workshop are to develop connections between researchers from different disciplines, increase awareness of differences and similarities in perspectives towards education research, and equip participants with strategies for engaging in interdisciplinary work. Fostering these interdisciplinary collaborations will result in improved research on learning in biology that will ultimately improve undergraduate biology education.<br/><br/>This project will support a one-day workshop for researchers in the LS and DBER-BIO communities. The workshop will foster interdisciplinary connections and identify strategies for collaboration through three activities: small group work, a panel discussion session with researchers who have experience in interdisciplinary collaborations, and a poster session. By the end of the workshop, it is anticipated that participants will have gained an appreciation of the value of interdisciplinary research and be equipped to pursue it. Data collected during the workshop will include discussion comments, collaborative strategies, and responses to an end-of-workshop survey. This data will be analyzed qualitatively using an in vivo approach for the first cycle of coding and focused coding for the second cycle to identify workshop outcomes. In turn, these will be evaluated to determine if the anticipated outcomes were met and to identify barriers to and facilitators of interdisciplinary collaboration as well as productive collaborative strategies. The PI team intends to share the results of this analysis through a meeting report, thus enabling the insights and strategies generated in the workshop to reach a broad audience.This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in ""Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action"" (http://visionandchange/finalreport).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The network will have three main activities: (1) interdisciplinary workshops that bring together practitioners, academics, agency managers and students; (2) student internships that provide introductory research experience for students using citizen science data and spatial and temporal datasets; and (3) collaborative assessments of student learning experiences. The network will focus on citizen science data collected for biodiversity questions--specifically species identification, species occurrence, and habitat parameters. The bioblitz activities, large public events focused on a 24 hour survey of biological diversity, are tools that engage citizens in science using inventories, smartphone apps, and other approaches. The addition of science parameters to the citizen science tool coupled with team learning activities engages students in both science and discovery. While an increasing number of studies focus on helping students decipher science, most assessment tools only indirectly measure student engagement and leadership in the sciences. The intellectual merit of this project is that it addresses the growing use of citizen science tools in the field and explores the potential for citizen science activities as new innovative approaches to engage underrepresented minority students in STEM especially using activities outside of the classroom and in the context of local communities. It is envisaged that these assessments will have both summative and formative applications to broadening participation in the environmental sciences.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the project include the faculty who come from a variety of biology and social science sub-disciplines at different career levels and from a wide range of institutions. In addition, the participating students come from many different types of institutions including community colleges, minority serving institutions and undergraduate institutions.  Both faculty and students reflect the growing diversity of the United States. Underrepresented minorities and especially students interested in connections to communities are selected as a part of a team that participates in the bioblitzes.  Students act as both research assistants and citizen sciences during the bioblitz so they both learn the science and grow into leadership. As a key outcome, the common standards and assessments will be used across multiple institutions and disciplines of biology to determine how discovery experiences using citizen science and informal settings outside the classroom can engage students in STEM fields.<br/><br/> This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

Current experimental tools for determining RNA modifications are laborious, noisy, and often do not provide exact locations of modified bases. Sequencing using Oxford Nanopore technology offers multiple advantages over Illumina sequencing including long reads and the ability to directly sequence RNA without the need for amplification, leading to reduced bias in coverage and the potential ability to uncover modified bases. The potential for discovering modified bases is still unfulfilled due to the lack of tools for this task. This project seeks to to make it significantly easier to identify RNA modifications globally and to help uncover the biological roles of the over 150 different types of RNA modifications. The challenge in the proposed research is that of the relatively small number of known modified bases, requiring clever design of sufficiently large labeled datasets, and necessitating the use of deep learning training algorithms that can succeed despite the relatively smaller datasets. The project draws upon recent developments in deep learning for tasks with few available labeled training examples to develop novel ways in which deep learning architectures for base calling can be applied to calling of modified RNA bases.<br/><br/>The proposed work will be transformative for research into RNA modifications and will enable the use of nanopore sequencing as a one-stop-shop for this purpose. Furthermore, it has the potential of leading to improved methods for the detection of targets of RNA-binding proteins, as several novel methods for this task are based on detecting modified RNA bases. Oxford Nanopore does not release the code for their production base calling software as open-source, limiting the ability of the research community to extend their methods to handle modifications. The tools designed as part of this work will provide a flexible open-source alternative, enabling progress on base calling of nanopore data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, understanding the fate of species in habitat fragments is imperative. Experimental studies of extinction are extremely rare outside of the laboratory. Thus, long term and large scale habitat fragmentation experiments provide real world understanding of extinction that cannot be uncovered in any other way. The Wog Wog experiment in southeastern Australia is the longest running, large scale experiment in temperate forest, fragmented since 1987. The experiment has provided major insights about which kinds of species are at greatest risk of extinction when their habitat is fragmented. The site is composed of original native eucalypt forest fragments now set within managed commercial pine plantation. These commercial pines are scheduled to be harvested, creating an unprecedented opportunity to discover, in an experimental setting, how extinction risk changes when fragments are re-fragmented, something that occurs commonly in practice. The researchers will determine how re-fragmentation impacts the extinction risk of species on fragments through changes to the environment and the ecosystem function of fragments. <br/><br/>Many university students will only take one science class, and often that class is Introductory Biology. Dr. Davies co-teaches 1400 Introductory Biology students every year and so has a great opportunity to inspire and increase STEM participation. She will transform the teaching of her large undergraduate biology class by focusing learning around her research at Wog Wog by: 1) focusing on established learning goals, developing mini case studies around video shot by graduate students in the field, and 2) bringing an undergraduate into the field every year to collect habitat structure data through digital photos that will be analysed by the whole class, and used by the PI to model changes to the environment. Dr. Davies hypothesizes that having real-world, real-time biology embedded in class will increase engagement and learning gains."

In humans, cyclophilins play key roles in numerous signaling pathways, are involved in viral life cycles for viruses such as HIV, and play roles in inflammation and cancer.  Recently, this family of proteins has been identified as RNA-binding proteins, and subsequent studies suggest RNA regulates the activity of this important family of proteins.  These findings provide a wholly new avenue of study to understand how cyclophilins are regulated and how they regulate key cellular processes important in health and disease. The goal of this research project is to identify the specific RNA molecules to which these proteins bind, what that binding interface looks like, and to determine the role(s) of these interactions in cyclophilin biology. This research program will have a broad impact on the scientific communities interested in cyclophilin and RNA biology and lead to the development of tools that will benefit studies by others that seek to understand the full array of RNA/protein interactions. This program also strongly promotes teaching, training and learning while advancing scientific discovery. These activities occur through well-designed and thoughtful mentoring strategies as well as through significant teaching innovations in the undergraduate classroom, including development of active learning environments and introduction of research-based labs in introductory science courses.<br/><br/>It is becoming apparent that many proteins are regulated by RNA in unforeseen ways. The cyclophilin-like domain (CLD) is consistently revealed as a non-canonical RNA-binding domain in every unbiased mammalian and yeast in vivo cross-linking study reported to date. Cyclophilins are a key cellular regulator and play important roles in numerous biological pathways. Their discovery as RNA-binding proteins suggests novel roles for RNAs in cyclophilin biology which have been hinted at by other observations, but as yet have not been fully explored. Targets include the CLD of cyclophilin A (CypA), a well-studied representative of CLDs that consists solely of this domain, and its yeast homolog Cpr1. Cyp33 was also selected for study because it contains both an RNA recognition motif (RRM) and CLD domain. RNA motifs responsible for interacting with the CLD will be identified initially by using in vitro selection strategies. In vivo binding sites will be identified using in cell photocrosslinking followed by pull down and deep sequencing of the associated RNAs. The mechanism of RNA activated CLD enzymatic activity will be elucidated. An unbiased transcriptome analysis in the absence of CLDs will reveal whether the transcripts found to be associated with CLD are directly impacted in vivo. The in vitro binding and enzymatic strategies employed will facilitate the development of a set of highly validated separation-of-function mutants. These tools will allow the correlation of CLD activity directly with transcriptome levels and also to uncover what aspects of the RNA life cycle are impacted by CLD action. Overall, this comprehensive research plan will help elucidate the novel roles cyclophilins play both directly and indirectly in RNA biology."

One explanation for this pattern is that new forms can arise by changes in gene regulation, that is, shifts in when and where those genes are active.  Although regulatory differences are known to underlie changes in features as complex as eyes and wings, it remains unclear how broadly this regulatory hypothesis applies and whether, in some cases, changes in the genes themselves are more important. This project will address this question by tracing the evolutionary changes involved in flower color transitions across Petunieae, a group of 140 species that includes the ornamental petunias.  The genes that produce floral pigments are well studied, making it possible to characterize the genetic changes associated with flower color evolution even at this broad scale.  As a part of this work, the researchers will create and present color-themed activities to diverse groups of K-12 students and undergraduates in order to enhance teaching and learning about the connections between genes, pathways, and phenotypes across the tree of life.<br/><br/>This project will test the role of regulatory evolution in the color diversification of Petunieae through three specific aims. The first aim will infer the history of flower color shifts in the clade using a new phylogeny constructed from transcriptomic data. Building on this phylogenetic framework, the second aim will use comparative methods and biochemical profiling to quantify the evolutionary relationship between changes in the expression of pigment pathway genes and color variation. Given the modular nature of the regulation of these genes, the third aim will test for correlated evolution of gene expression across the phylogeny. These aims will be carried out through collaborations with botanists from Brazil and Argentina, who will participate in research exchanges to foster the sharing of knowledge and techniques. At a local scale, the research activities will be integrated into outreach events as well as inquiry-based course modules for undergraduates and upward-bound high school students. These innovative teaching approaches will be coupled with new tools to assess learning gains and guide improvement."

However, even though approximately half of biology majors complete coursework at community colleges (CCs), including disproportionate numbers of under-served students, only 3% of recent BER papers included a CC author or CC study context. This raises concerns that existing BER may have failed to characterize the educational experiences of half of the relevant undergraduate population and that innovations stemming from BER might not be reaching CCs. This project is a grassroots effort driven by a strong nationwide group of CC faculty to promote, conduct, and publish CC BER. The network will mobilize diverse stakeholders from CC settings including students, faculty and administrators to journal editors and national society leaders to enhance the representation of CCs in BER. Grounded in the unique values and cultures of CCs, it will provide opportunities for intellectual support, infrastructure support, and social support to mitigate previously hypothesized constraints on CC BER and empower CC faculty to engage in and publish BER. The project will thus address the paucity of BER from CC contexts and contribute insights that can improve life science instruction for students from underserved groups across all institutional contexts. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the project is to address research questions about the types of social, infrastructure and intellectual support CC BER. These networks will build on established models of change, provide answers to research questions regarding hypothesized constraints to CC BER, and integrate with existing networks. At the core of this national effort will be 20 geographically dispersed, regional CC BER networks. These regional networks, consisting of approximately five individuals representing CC faculty, administrators, students, future CC faculty, and CC BER advocates, will meet regularly and make substantial progress on one or more collaborative CC BER projects. The national network effort will provide intellectual resources in the form of faculty development experiences in BER at an opening national meeting, ongoing mentorship for regional networks, and travel to national BER conferences. Additionally, the network will provide critical resources often absent at CCs, such as access to an Institutional Review Board and journal articles. The project will culminate with presentations by regional teams at a national BER meeting and preparation of manuscripts related to regional efforts. As a result, the new CC BER network will make substantial, novel contributions to the present body of knowledge regarding CC biology teaching and learning and will provide insights into how networks can support innovation at CCs and in education research broadly.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/)."

Although much has been learned about the consequences of genome doubling in recent years, many fundamental questions remain regarding how genome duplication contributes to plant biology and crop productivity. An important dimension of genome duplication is how the now-doubled nuclear genome interacts with other genomic compartments found within the plant cell, such as the mitochondria and plastids. The planned research will investigate this underexplored aspect of genome duplications, with implications for how cellular energetics, which play a key role in growth, reproduction, and yield, are altered in the wake of genome doubling events. The research will use a diverse panel of important crop systems and state-of-the-art genomics techniques. Project resources, data, and personnel will be used to expand outreach and education programs, including an international workshop series on genomics and a long-term effort to provide high school teachers with an immersive experience in hands-on research and curricular development. The project will create training opportunities for participants across the full range of educational and career stages in both research and service-learning. In sum, this research aims to provide fundamental insights into genome interactions and crop biology and broaden participation in plant biological research.<br/><br/>Allopolyploidy events entail the simultaneous merger of genomes from two divergent lineages combined with the doubling of nuclear genome content. Because cytoplasmic genomes are typically inherited from only a single (maternal) parent, allopolyploidization is expected to have complex effects on the relative copy number (i.e., stoichiometry) of nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes, and also create novel, ""untested"" pairings of nuclear and cytoplasmic genotypes. The planned research will reveal the spectrum of genomic responses that alleviate the disruptive effects of allopolyploidy on cytonuclear interactions and facilitate the successful establishment of hybrid/polyploid lineages. Bioinformatic analyses will test for predicted compensatory responses in organelle-targeted nuclear genes that resolve maladapted interactions between the paternally derived nuclear subgenome and maternally derived cytoplasmic genomes, including: (1) maternally biased gene conversion; (2) altered selection pressures on sequence evolution in the paternal subgenome; (3) paternally biased pseudogenization and gene loss; and (4) preferential down-regulation of paternal homoeologs. By taking advantage of >600 re-sequenced genomes from cotton allopolyploids, the proposed research will be extended to the population-genomic level to detect these effects ""in action"". Finally, the relative copy number of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic genomes and the relative expression levels in the nucleus, mitochondria, and plastids will be precisely quantified to differentiate among multiple hypothesized responses to stoichiometric imbalance. Together, these analyses will provide a powerful test of whether and how cytonuclear interactions contribute to the formation and evolution of polyploid crops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology.  This study examines how the diet of an animal can help it survive attacks from other animals.  The Fellow studies the fall webworm, a caterpillar that eats the leaves of different trees.  Fall webworms are attacked by parasitic insects that lay their eggs inside the caterpillar and use it as a host.  The caterpillar's immune system can help defend against these parasitic insects, but the strength of the immune system can be affected by the caterpillar's diet.  The Fellow uses experiments and field surveys in Colorado to understand whether different trees increase the immunity of the fall webworm against wasp attacks.  The survival of insects, like many animals, is dependent on the plants in their habitat.  As changes in climate transform many plant communities, insects are likely to be affected too. This study will increase understanding of how plant-insect interactions might change if major climatic events drastically modify plant communities.  In addition, the Fellow works closely with youth from underrepresented minority students from urban areas in Denver.  Students will participate in wildlife surveys, which increase awareness of wildlife. The fellow will also promote opportunities for mentorship and guidance by creating an online network of biologists from minority backgrounds who will advise high school students. <br/><br/>For widely distributed animals, the relative importance of diet and natural enemies can vary depending on location and composition of ecological communities.  The Fellow will use genomics to identify and quantify the diversity of parasitic insects attacking fall webworm across its range in Colorado. Next, the Fellow will use lab experiments to measure the relationship between diet and the nutrient quality of fall webworms.  Finally, the Fellow will manipulate the caterpillar's diet to examine how different tree species impact the caterpillar's ability to launch immune defenses against parasitic insects.  This research includes two approaches to increase interactions with nature among underrepresented minority students in urban public schools. First, the Fellow will use an experiential learning model to create interactive out-of-school learning opportunities for middle school students. Second, the Fellow will build an online network of professional biologists who agree to be mentors for high school students with interests in biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Innovative remote sensing using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), NEON's Airborne Observatory, and the GEDI satellite will allow rapid monitoring of forest structure at very high resolution across thousands of hectares-providing a critical and often missing scale of observations. With these remote sensing data and other advances, regional to continental scale ecology can now explore large areas at very fine scales.

The world remains green with plants because a variety of factors limit the intensity of herbivory.  Understanding these limiting factors is an important goal of ecology.  This research focuses on how the seasonal timing of interactions between plants and herbivorous insects could limit herbivory. The project examines interactions between plants and their herbivorous aphids, which form vast colonies on the flowering stalks of the plants, making them an ideal study system for experimental manipulation. The aphid colonies interact with other insects, including ants that provide them with protection from predators. Six years of data show that when snow melts earlier in spring, host plants flower earlier, and this earlier flowering tends to be associated with an increase in aphid numbers.  To understand what is causing this association, the researchers will experimentally alter snow cover as a way to vary the timing of plant-insect interactions.  This work is important because it adds to our understanding of how changes in the timing of when organisms interact with each other, affect food webs, and the resulting ecological communities. The results will have implications for predicting the abundance of insect herbivores in natural and agricultural systems affected by an earlier arrival of spring. This project will also provide undergraduate students from under-served communities with training in field ecology, and will develop learning opportunities for K-12 teachers and students.<br/><br/>Using a combination of observational and experimental approaches, this research will determine the direct and indirect effects of changes in plant phenology on herbivore abundance.  In this study system, aphids (Aphis helianthi) colonize the inflorescences of their host plant (Ligusticum porteri), and six years of monitoring indicates that advances in host-plant phenology (earlier flowering) are associated with increases in the abundance of aphids. This correlation between plant phenology and the abundance of herbivores may be due to the direct effects of phenology on plant nutritional quality and/or to the indirect mediation of interactions among ants, predators and competitors. This study will apply a structural equation modeling approach to evaluate hypotheses about how phenological cues influence arthropod abundance through these direct and indirect trophic interactions. The study will directly vary host plant phenology through the experimental manipulation of snow melt using plant populations found along an elevational gradient. These experiments will also employ a factorial design to combine plant phenology treatments with treatments that alter the accessibility of aphid colonies to their mutualists and/or predators.  Differences in aphid colony growth among treatments will show the relative magnitudes of direct and indirect effects of plant stage.  Laboratory assays of phloem sap and aphid quality (e.g., C/N ratio, secondary metabolite content etc.) will complement these field experiments and provide a mechanism by which host plant phenology could affect aphid population growth or the ant-aphid mutualism."

In recent years, efforts have been made to enhance the communication skills of graduate students and faculty. However, undergraduate students far outnumber scientists with advanced degrees and are likely to interact frequently with a broad set of public stakeholders. Biology undergraduates are ideally situated to help translate science and reach a broad audience. To better serve these roles, undergraduates need formal training and practice in science communication. The SciComm RCN-UBE will unify a group of researchers dedicated to improving the communication skills of undergraduate students so they may more effectively convey scientific discoveries to the public. Effective science communication of all types engages citizens in scientific practices and discovery, educates policymakers, and facilitates an accurate representation of the scientific process and its discoveries.<br/><br/>Work to enhance undergraduate science communication is currently happening in silos with little communication between them. There is thus a need to bring practitioners together to assess best practices and articulate a clear research agenda. To that end, the SciComm Network has two objectives: 1) build a collaborative, interdisciplinary community of scholars dedicated to training undergraduate students in effective science communication for the public; and 2) disseminate teaching tools, articulate a research agenda, and plan for objective evaluation of undergraduate science communication training programs. These objectives will be achieved by holding a workshop to facilitate collaboration between faculty from eleven diverse institutions--public and private universities, minority-serving institutions, a museum, a military academy, and community colleges--evaluating existing science communication programs and generating a web-based repository of undergraduate science communication resources. SciComm also aims to identify outstanding ""grand challenges"" in science communication education and consult with science learning researchers and evaluators to provide quantitative and qualitative assessments of the role of training in developing undergraduate communication skills, content knowledge, and self-efficacy. In this way, SciComm will move the field beyond acknowledging the need to train undergraduate students in science communication to improving how it is done, thereby impacting the perception and understanding of science by the public at large.<br/><br/>Co-funding for this project is being provided by the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) program in recognition of the project's alignment with the overarching goals of the IUSE: EHR program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students will also help organize workshops in Mexico; these international service-learning experiences will be designed with the goal of boosting recruitment and retention at the US universities of underrepresented minority groups in technical and quantitative disciplines.<br/><br/>The research project will focus on a protease enzyme complex (Clp) in plastids that exhibits accelerated evolution and extreme signatures of positive selection in both plastid- and nuclear-encoded subunits. Biochemical and phenotypic consequences of changes in protein sequences will be investigated by modifying the plastid genome in the Nicotiana tabacum model system. Proteomic techniques will be used to assess assembly of the enzyme complex and effects of the protease on plastid protein content. Finally, comparative genomic approaches will be used to analyze correlated rates of protein sequence evolution to discover previously unrecognized interactions between plastid and nuclear genes. Collectively, these lines of investigation will test the hypothesis that antagonistic plastid-nuclear interactions have driven accelerated evolution of the plastid Clp complex."

Animals and plants must synchronize their lives with the seasons to avoid freezing or overheating and to exploit seasonal resources. The goal of this grant is to understand how historic and contemporary shifts in seasonality can facilitate biological diversification in insect communities. In the short term, such shifts have caused rapid evolution of new crop pests and associated parasite communities. The proposed research tests 1) whether the same processes explain more ancient diversification of communities, and 2) whether changing climates will disrupt or promote diversification in the future. The results may inform many scientific fields, from basic research on the genesis of new species to applied control of agricultural pests. This project includes workshops with high school teachers and students to build curricula supporting ""learning by doing"" and meeting national standards, as well as providing training for graduate students and postdocs. <br/><br/>This project includes genomic analysis of dipteran pest insects, including the apple fly Rhagoletis pomonella and blueberry maggot fly Rhagoletis mendax plus the community of parasitoid wasps that attack these flies. Genomic work will integrate with 1) functional studies of the overwintering hibernation of both the flies and the wasps from hormonal and molecular perspectives, and 2) computational simulations of the responses of the flies and their parasites to projected seasonal shifts resulting from climate change."

Gametes usually carry one copy of each chromosome and, when they combine in the process of fertilization, create a new cell, called a zygote, that has two copies of each chromosome. Over the last century the budding/brewers'/bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has become a powerful experimental system for learning about how genes work and how cells duplicate and separate their chromosomes and divide. However, very little is known about how yeast cells make gametes and how yeast fertilization works. Dr. McMurray's lab found that, contrary to prior assumptions, (i) yeast gametes are made ""pre-oriented"" in terms of the direction in which they grow prior to fertilization; (ii) if they forego mating and choose instead to start dividing with only a single set of chromosomes, they must first penetrate a cell wall that encases the gametes, and (iii) yeast gametes that fail to inherit all the chromosomes they are supposed to get are still capable of fertilization, and can produce a viable zygote so long as the other gamete has the missing chromosome(s). This project will elucidate the molecular bases of these three phenomena, providing major advances in understanding of gamete biology and how genetic information is transmitted during reproduction. An outreach program will partner local middle school students and Early Education majors in isolating wild yeast and looking for clues from gene sequences about how fertilization happens in various natural habitats, enriching curricula at both levels. <br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which Saccharomyces gametes (spores) exit dormancy, escape from a specialized, inflexible cell wall, and subsequently mate or bud. The objectives of this project are to determine how spores are born ""pre-polarized"", how upon budding they penetrate the ascus wall (the residual wall of the diploid mother cell), and how a ""maternal contribution"" of RNAs allows spores to germinate and mate without accessing their genomes. The hypotheses are that 1) polarity factors deposited in spore membranes during sporulation persist at cortical locations near the ascus wall, 2) secreted cell-wall degrading enzymes allow local digestion of the ascus wall during budding, and 3) many RNAs made during sporulation are shared between spores, whereas those controlling mating type are segregated. Imaging and genetic manipulation in the Principal Investigator's lab and the lab of a collaborator will pinpoint when, where and which polarity factors are deposited during sporulation and which are required for polarity establishment. Similar imaging and mutation-based approaches will identify the cell wall degradation enzymes required for ascus wall penetration. In order to resolve the paradox of how spores share maternal molecules but segregate those required to establish identity, the Principal Investigator's lab will monitor the localization and temporal origin of essential and mating-type specific RNAs during sporulation, and manipulate candidate pathways controlling RNA segregation, including targeted RNA degradation, RNA methylation, clustering of RNAs by RNA-binding proteins, and production of anti-sense transcripts.<br/><br/>This project is co-funded by Integrative Organismal Systems, Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Rules of Life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies of local adaptation have historically focused on geographically separated populations, where adaptive differences are maintained by limited dispersal of individuals between populations. Growing evidence, however, suggests that adaptive evolution can occur over small spatial distances. How this fine scale, adaptation arises and is maintained remains unresolved, despite applications for human health, agriculture, and biodiversity. On Santa Cruz Island, the Island Scrub Jay has two morphologies. Birds in pine habitat have long and thin beaks where as those in oak habitats have short and deep beaks. These differences are known to facilitate feeding on pine cones versus acorns, but how such adaptive genetic differences are maintained over very small geographic distances is unknown. The researchers will collect data on the genomes of individuals from both types of habitats to test if the same set of genes are differentiated between pine and oak populations, and how other regions of the genome change spatially across the island. These measurements will be coupled with telemetry studies that track how birds move and use oak and pine habitats. In addition, vocal experiments will test if males prefer females that originate within their habitat. The data obtained from this work will then be used to develop general models that can inform the conditions under with adaptive differences in can occur. Such models would be of interest to conservation managers that manage this and other unique or rare species. Additionally, the project will produce a learning module for high school classroom use, and will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>Cases of microgeographic adaptation challenge classical evolutionary theory that posits adaptive divergence should be constrained by gene flow, leading to a reassessment of the spatial scale at which evolutionary processes occur. The research team has recently discovered replicated, adaptive divergence in jay bill shape in adjacent oak and pine habitats, despite gene flow between these adjacent habitats. This pattern occurs across habitats separated by less than one kilometer. The researchers will test alternative hypotheses about how divergent selection, dispersal, and non-random mating shape adaptive divergence in bill morphology. In Aim 1, they develop population genetic models that test the interacting effects of selection, gene flow, assortative mating, and genetic architecture at different spatial scales. In Aim 2, they will test for divergent selection by measuring selection gradients, examining patterns of genomic divergence, and by identifying candidate genes associated with variation in bill morphology. In Aim 3, they will use a combination of population genomics, telemetry, and transplant experiments to test for population genomic structure and if dispersal is non-random In Aim 4, they will test if divergence in bill morphology is correlated with vocalizations and facilitates assortative mating. Collectively, the proposed work takes an integrative approach in a tractable study system. This research has broad implications for understanding both the spatial scale at which adaptive divergence occurs, and the conditions that allow individuals within a single population to diverge across heterogeneous habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predation success determines survival for nearly all animals, be they predator or potential prey. We know little, however, about the specific movement abilities of predators and prey in nature and how they determine the outcomes of life-or-death encounters. It is difficult to study natural predation; these events are rare and difficult to anticipate. Predators use a variety of movement strategies to hunt prey: striking with great speed, sneaking up stealthily, and maneuvering quickly and repeatedly during pursuit, to name a few. This research will address how bats hunt insects using different predation strategies, dissecting the physiology and anatomy that underlie the abilities of particular species to select their form of pursuit. This research will provide rich learning opportunities for teams of students in biology, engineering and computer science. It will develop a science communication internship program at Brown University where students will transform research videos of bats hunting insects into media that will be distributed globally and that highlight the importance of bats and insects to our ecosystems.<br/><br/>This project uses the model system of bats and insects to link detailed understanding of the mechanistic basis of locomotion with experiments and simulations that examine how movement abilities influence predator-prey interactions.

Here the forest is in near continual mist and luxuriant growth of epiphytic orchids, bromeliads and mosses carpet the trees. These ecosystems are not only beautiful, but play a critical role in biodiversity protection, water resources, and human livelihoods. Yet they are among the least known ecosystems in the world and are likely to be exceptionally vulnerable to global change. This project builds on an international research coordination network to dramatically increase our understanding of these ecosystems. Currently that understanding is limited by nonstandard approaches and research methods across sites, cultural differences among the scientific disciplines and countries where these ecosystems occur, and a lack of synthesis of current research. In this study, a central theme will be based on a set of characteristics that is common across all tropical montane cloud forests, including small, stunted and very slow growing trees that will serve to organize and standardize research. In so doing, it will also lead to standardized scientific techniques, new technologies and interdisciplinary approaches, and synthesis of datasets across large scales. Indeed, this cannot be accomplished without an integrated network, since the key drivers, such as climate, physiography, and ecological isolation, vary tremendously over large distances from islands to mainlands, equatorial to subtropical regions, and from coasts to inland mountain ranges. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this network are numerous. Its focus on knowledge sharing and promoting teaching and learning will be accomplished through web based information modules serving a general audience. These will include a primer on the unique role of tropical montane cloud forests in ecosystem functioning, focusing especially on water resources. Standardized scientific methods will be developed as written protocols and video tutorials produced to promote additional adoption. This project will inherently enhance the capacity for research and education by bringing together an international network of researchers, initiating multisite studies and experiments, and hosting international meetings at key research sites. A key impact will be the training and mentoring of students in tropical countries, vital for the future, but where student opportunities are usually limited. Finally, the network will develop a forest management protocol and a web based forum for forest managers to discuss the latest findings and problem solving."

Although the conversion of the NMR data into interatomic distances requires in-depth understanding of the underlying physics and mathematics, the software to be developed will render this knowledge unnecessary. The project specifically concerns RNA, but some of the methods will boost the applicability to proteins as well. In combination with the anticipated reduction in measuring time, this will make the protocol attractive to the NMR spectroscopy and structural biology communities. Educationally, structural dynamics studies of RNA molecules have been largely unrepresented while the scientific communities' focus has centered on average structural representation. Macromolecules and their interactions are dynamic in nature and this is why it is critical to learn how to evaluate motions in parallel with structure. Thus, mentoring students on how to bridge this gap is a critical part of this proposed project, especially considering that the general field of macromolecular dynamics experimentation has moved quickly within recent years. A summer student from the RNA Bioscience Initiative \ Summer Internship Program at the University of Colorado will be recruited, which offers access to top-level research experience for students from institutions with limited research programs.<br/><br/>RNA not only is the template for translating the genetic code into proteins, but also carries out diverse important cellular functions. Understanding these functions absolutely depends on knowledge of the structural arrangement at atomic resolution, and, as is becoming increasingly evident, the conformational dynamics of RNA molecules. Almost one-half of the determined RNA structures have been solved by NMR. However, high-resolution RNA structures can rarely be obtained from the most popular and successful NMR probe alone, the Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement (NOE). Instead, many additional semi-empirical restraints and labor-intensive techniques only accessible to experts are required to obtain a structural average, and there are only a few experimentally derived ensembles of structures representing realistic spatial sampling. Therefore, the structural biology community is in need of novel methods that improve the pool of structural data that can be collected and used for RNA structure determination. In principle, the NOE directly depends on the distance between two atoms. However, the NOE is employed as a semi-quantitative upper limit distance restraint. The non-exact nature of this restraint means that important information about structure and dynamics is lost. It is our idea to measure the NOE exactly (eNOE), which can be converted into a tight distance limit. In ideal cases, such a distance can be measured to an accuracy of ca. 10-11 meters and can be obtained for hundreds of proton pairs in an RNA molecule. These project proposes to establish an efficient protocol to improve NMR structures of RNA of all sizes using the exact NOE (eNOE) approach, enabling RNA researchers to calculate multi-state structural ensembles for small RNAs, and improving average structures or specific local structural aspects for larger RNAs. It is the intellectual merit of this project that the eNOE distance will improve all types of determined NMR structures: i) structures of small RNAs (up to 20 nucleotides) may be defined at high resolution without any other restraints; the eNOE can also be used to calculate multi-state structural ensembles to realistically sample their conformational space, ii) larger RNA molecules will result in improved average structures. We will offer NMR pulse sequence codes and our eNOE analysis program eNORA for free download from our webpage. This protocol should help researchers to study RNA structures at higher resolution, a prerequisite for better understanding of RNA function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Results from this work will advance a growing body of evidence that underscores the importance of parental care not only for offspring nutrition and survival but also how social experiences early in life contribute to development of offspring stress response and health throughout life and improve understanding of the proposed Rule of Life, developing a modeling framework will serve as a road map for future studies. Educational outreach will be accomplished through public presentations and blog posts while a statistical modeling workshop will be offered to university students recruited from groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines.  <br/> <br/>Quantity and quality of parental care have lifelong impacts on development of offspring stress phenotypes. For example, in mammals, birds, fish, and insects, variation in parental care corresponds with substantial and persistent differences in offspring stress physiology and behaviors. Yet, much remains unknown about the underlying mechanisms that link experiences early in life with phenotypes later in life - an especially puzzling question given the long latency between the initial exposure and the phenotypic outcome. Such questions motivate investigating the Rule of Life: experiences of parental care early in life have profound and lasting impacts on an offspring?s stress phenotype. This research uses North American barn swallows to test the hypothesis that inadequate parental care leads to a dysregulated stress hormone response in offspring later in life, and that this relationship is mediated by DNA methylation. Observational data and a cross-fostering, brood manipulation experiment will be used to determine the extent to which parental care corresponds to development of offspring stress phenotype via a DNA methylation mechanism. In addition to testing this hypothesis, the Fellow will learn advanced statistical approaches to derive unbiased estimates of association and improve causal inference, with an emphasis on modeling high-dimensional genomics data.

They are dominant predators of insects and other arthropods in arid habitats and are also important prey for many desert species. Solifuges are notoriously difficult to study since they are hard to find and collect, nearly impossible to keep alive in the lab, and challenging to identify. Contrary to their name, they are not true spiders and do not build webs but represent a unique arachnid group with over 1,100 species known worldwide. With only a few scientists studying any aspect of their biology, there is a pressing need to train a new generation of scientists devoted to the biology of this diverse group. This project will revolutionize the study of this component of the planet's biodiversity by training young biologists, including high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scholar. They will use state-of-the-art molecular tools to better understand the evolutionary relationships among species in the most common and diverse group of camel spiders in North America, the Eremobatidae. Another goal of the project is to use camel spiders as a model system to explore how Earth history events have influenced the evolution and assembly of species in desert communities. This grant leverages the only remaining expertise on North American camel spiders to excite a new generation of scientists who will move this field forward. An innovative and interactive online identification guide, the Camel Spiders of North America, will be developed to enable scientists, naturalists, educators, and others to identify and learn about these little-known animals. The guide will provide a resource for a broad audience and will support the development and expansion of an informative new website on camel spider biology (www.solifugae.info).<br/><br/>This project addresses the systematic and taxonomic impediments in the study of camel spiders by using existing expertise to train students in cutting-edge phylogenomic, biogeographic, and taxonomic methodology. A recently published multi-locus phylogeny of one of the largest families of camel spiders, the Eremobatidae, will provide a starting point for a more thorough analysis using targeted enrichment of ultraconserved elements, along with novel and underexplored morphological characters thought to be taxonomically informative. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) will be used to generate genome-wide SNP data for the very first phylogeographic analyses of camel spiders by examining two well-defined species groups. Extensive fieldwork carried out as part of this project, particularly in the Chihuahuan Desert, Baja California peninsula, and California Coast Ranges, will undoubtedly reveal many new species in this family, greatly enhancing the understanding of arachnid diversity present in these under-explored arid ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While twenty percent of the world population lives in river basins fed by melt waters from snow or glaciers, we know very little about how changes in snowpack and temperature in high mountain areas will affect biodiversity conservation or the management of water resources. Ecosystem responses to increasing temperature occur over many years to many decades, so long-term observations and long-term experiments are required to detect and understand those responses. The NWT LTER research provides an important reference point for regional, national, and global networks to measure changes in the water cycle and life at high elevations. The mountainous lands associated with NWT provides a natural laboratory in which to explore why some habitats may be very sensitive to changes in the environment while other areas may not be sensitive. The natural setting of NWT also provides many features that can help promote and develop an interest in science and nature, and inspire schoolchildren and the public to learn about the ecology of mountains and the tundra.<br/><br/>The NWT LTER program builds on over 35 years of long-term measurements and experiments to better understand where and when climate change results in ecological change, and to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to responsiveness or stability in ecological systems. Specific objectives include (a) using long-term observations to characterize how high-mountain environments are responding to climate, (b) using long-term experiments to test hypotheses about the underlying drivers and integration among these responses, and (c) integrating this information in modeling frameworks to both refine understanding and forecast responses to future change. The research is conceptually organized around how climate change translates to ecological response across a spatially complex landscape and across ecological levels of organization. Proposed questions derive from theory on climate exposure in complex terrain and compensatory dynamics, and the long-term observations and interdisciplinary expertise at NWT allow comprehensive tests of these theories. Specific investigations are framed by substantial variation in ecological responses to long-term trends in climate at NWT involving warmer spring and summer temperatures, earlier snowmelt and lake ice-off, and longer growing seasons. Research will focus on treeline and subalpine forest, and alpine and subalpine lakes, and alpine tundra ecosystems. Outreach and training addresses a broad range of audiences, including K-12 students, the general public, and citizen scientists, while emphasizing training of graduate students in science communication and engaged scholarship."

New species are defined by the combination of traits that prevent them from mating with other species. However, these traits are not static ? they vary depending on the history of a particular population and across different environments. The researchers will use a combination of field and laboratory-based experiments to identify key traits that define two closely related species and test how those traits vary across space. They will then expand their study to other closely related species to test whether traits that define speciation are predictable across a group of species. The project will test new genome sequencing tools in wild populations, inspiring new areas of research in evolution, behavior, and conservation. It will also contribute to the understanding of how new species arise, how they persist across different environments, and whether comparisons between related species are useful to learn about speciation when applied to a broader group of organisms. Through this project, the researchers will provide critical training to undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers. The researchers will also develop public citizen science resources to help document species diversity across the Colorado Front Range. These resources will improve undergraduate science curriculum and public science education through meaningful scientific experiences.<br/><br/>Classic evolutionary theory assumes that species boundaries are fixed differences between species, but barriers between species vary over different temporal, spatial, ecological, and historical contexts. The extent and consequences of this variation on the evolution and maintenance of species boundaries is largely unknown and has not been studied comprehensively in a single system. The proposed research will connect patterns of population level variation to the origin and maintenance of reproductive barriers across a species complex. It will integrate studies of barrier phenotypes (temporal, habitat, behavioral, fertilization, and postzygotic isolation) with patterns of spatial variation in recombination, hybridization, and selection. The researchers will use replicate hybrid zones of North American field crickets to understand variation in reproductive barriers across different scales of biological diversity?within species, between species across multiple independent contact zones of different ages, and across a species complex with overlapping ranges. Key outcomes will be 1) integration of the ecological, behavioral, and genomic context for variation in species barriers, 2) an empirical test of the role of variable reproductive barriers in maintaining species boundaries, 3) a test of the repeatability of the evolution of reproductive barriers across multiple species pairs, and 4) meaningful research experiences for undergraduate non-STEM majors and the public that will increase public engagement with, and appreciation for, nature and science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models. Finally, several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained. Results of the project will be published at the following url: www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org."

Because iron is both necessary and harmful, the amount, location and form of iron within an animal must be tightly controlled. In humans and other mammals, the physiological processes that provide the right amount of iron at the right times are partially understood. However, in insects and other invertebrate animals, these processes have not yet been discovered. The goal of this research project is to understand how iron is transported from one cell to another in insects using the fruit fly as a model system. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. Knowledge gained from this research will provide a framework for future studies of iron transport in blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes, which must cope with a seemingly toxic amount of iron when they ingest a blood meal. A potential outcome of this project is the discovery of a more evolutionarily ancient iron transport mechanism that functions not only in insects but also in other invertebrate animals. In addition, information learned from this research may provide insight into the less-understood mechanisms of iron transport in humans. Finally, because insect management strategies rely on information about insect biology, the results of this project may contribute to the development of a new insect control strategy. <br/><br/>The goal of the proposed research is to understand the physiological mechanisms of iron transport in insects. Four models that describe possible mechanisms of iron transport into cells will be tested using Drosophila melanogaster as the model insect species. OBJECTIVE 1: The first objective is to test the hypothesis that receptor-mediated endocytosis of iron-loaded ferritin or ferric-transferrin transports iron from hemolymph into cells. 1A) Ferritin and transferrin will be labeled with a fluorophore and then observed to determine whether cellular uptake occurs. 1B) Confocal microscopy will be used to evaluate whether ferritin or transferrin are present in endosomes. 1C) Essential components of the endocytosis pathways will be blocked, and the effect on iron uptake will be measured. OBJECTIVE 2: The second objective is to test the hypothesis that reduction of ferric ions in hemolymph leads to iron transport into cells. Hemolymph contains iron in the ferric form, but iron transporters in animals are specific to ferrous iron; therefore, iron uptake via an influx transporter is likely to require a reduction step. The functions of a known ferric reductase, CG8399, and a candidate ferric reductase, CG1275, will be studied. 2A) RNAi will be used to determine whether CG8399 or CG1275 contribute to cell surface ferric reductase activity. 2B) RNAi will be used to determine whether the activity of CG8399 or CG1275 influences the iron content of cells. 2C) A membrane-impermeant ferrous chelator will be evaluated for its ability to inhibit iron uptake."

Examples of this include white nose syndrome which is devastating bat populations in the US, and Chytrid fungus outbreaks that have caused declines in frog populations worldwide.  Some diseases of wildlife, for example, Rabies, Ebola, and West Nike Virus, can cause outbreaks of disease in people, while other infections of wildlife, such as Brucellosis and African Swine Fever, can be fatal to domestic animals and livestock.  Extraordinary new tools greatly improve our ability to detect infection and understand why it sometimes is devastating and sometimes not. While these new technologies make this an exciting time for new discoveries and understanding that will improve wildlife disease management, many researchers would benefit from training in their use. To address this need, we offer hands-on training with real-world data through an intensive workshop ""Genomics of Disease in Wildlife"" (GDW).  The first two workshops offered in 2017 and 2018 were very successful and provided training for nearly 50 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty in Next Generation DNA Sequencing analysis to use in projects about wildlife diseases. Going forward, this project will provide scholarships to 12-14 graduate students or fellows (US citizens) with financial need to attend workshops in 2019 and 2020.  We will preferentially use these funds to enhance diverse or underrepresented minority participation and have been successful in recruiting women and diverse attendees to maximize training impacts. This financial assistance will also facilitate building a cohesive, effective scientific community making breakthroughs in control of infectious wildlife diseases. For example, we have recently published a manuscript helping the scientific community identify critical next challenges, and the GDW workshop alumni are also involved in a listserv to promote communications among a growing number of researchers with interest and expertise in GDW problems.  <br/><br/><br/>Recent technological advances in genomic sciences, and increasingly affordable Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay costs, have coalesced to result in powerful tools to monitor, detect, and reconstruct the past, present, and future role of pathogens impacting wildlife populations. Wildlife researchers are thus uniquely positioned to merge ecological, biological, and evolutionary studies with such genomic technologies to exploit unprecedented ""Big Data"" tools in disease research; however, most researchers lack the training and expertise required to use these computationally intensive methodologies. Previous workshops have consisted of lectures, daily computer labs, and analysis of real-world NGS data.  Previous workshops have provided comprehensive training in the use of genomic tools for investigations of a broad range of interactions between wildlife host species and their pathogens, and provided unique networking opportunities among instructors, guest speakers, and participants. This project will provide support for two additional years of workshops. Funds will be awarded as scholarships for US graduate students and post-doctoral fellows interested in obtaining skills in this emerging area. This award will encourage participation by early career researchers.  Participants will learn modern genomics techniques and generate powerful genomic solutions to ameliorate the local, regional, and global impact of wildlife disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are thousands of genes in the genome of any organism, so it is a major challenge to decipher the role of each gene. The focus of this project is to build a new and more efficient technology platform that will enable researchers to efficiently understand how mutations in a gene affect the function encoded by that gene. This platform which uses the tools of synthetic biology will allow researchers to develop such understanding much more rapidly. Such efforts are central to a broad range of applications in both applied and basic science. It may help with the development of new strains for the production of pharmaceutical proteins, enzymes, chemicals, or fuels. It will also help to develop forward engineering paradigms central to the future of bioengineering. In the development of this platform, the investigators will also train multiple graduate and undergraduate students in cutting edge science, technology, engineering and mathematical (STEM) approaches and technologies.  These students will develop expertise in experimental and computational methods, the design, execution, and reporting of scientific research, and the generation of intellectual property. <br/><br/>A fundamental goal of synthetic biology is to develop new paradigms for the forward engineering of biological systems. The prototypical forward engineering process involves design, build, test, and learn (DBTL) stages, which ideally are performed in a cyclical and highly parallel fashion leading to the build up of knowledge bases, codified design rules, and optimized designs. In biological endeavors, the ""DBTL"" strategy has historically been realized through ""sequence to activity relationship (SAR)"" mutational mapping, which has traditionally been limited in throughput to addressing only the smallest of biological systems. Advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies however, have paved the way for new massively parallel approaches to SAR that extend to the genome scale. Several technologies that have been developed will be optimized in a generally accessible framework for use by the larger synthetic biology community.  Such a framework will enable new forward DBTL-type engineering strategies at scales that are orders of magnitude more advanced than methods currently available. The investigators in this project have chosen to focus their efforts on the comprehensive mapping of gene essentiality in the model bacterium Escherichia coli because this model system is not only ideal for demonstrating their platform but also will allow them to address foundational questions concerning essentiality, evolvability, epistasis and fitness. This will have broad implications across genetics, synthetic biology and biotechnology."

Researchers will use these data to study what types of watersheds are best at retaining nutrients, are recovering most rapidly from decades of acid rain, have the highest erosion rates, and have flow patterns that are least sensitive to floods and droughts. The lessons we learn from studying many watersheds and streams will contribute to more effective management of our nation's water and forest resources.<br/><br/>Much of the literature of watershed ecosystem science over the last decade has focused on gaining ever finer detail of spatial heterogeneity within watersheds. This fine-scale focus has identified many idiosyncrasies of individual watersheds but has not helped us develop general theories about watershed dynamics. Most watershed ecosystem studies remain rather parochial, involving detailed studies of individual or paired watersheds, or surveys of a small set of attributes across multiple watersheds. Macrosystem watershed science, or the search for general principles that describe the functional capacity and behavior across watersheds, has been limited. A major reason for this lack of large-scale focus is the challenge of data access and integration across sites.

One challenge in developing a general modeling framework is that developmental biases are unique to the structure and species in question. This research will incorporate models of cartilage and bone growth into an evolutionary framework. The researchers will build on recent comparisons of ear structures among toads; many toad species have impaired ear development and lack structures commonly important for hearing. The project will bring together researchers and students with mechanical engineers to create a mathematical model that predicts ear structures based on developmental parameters. The model will examine evolutionary changes that can switch whether or not toad species develop ears. This framework will form a general foundation that can be applied to other structures to understand how developmental processes limit possible outcomes of mutations. The increased collaboration between engineers and biologists will provide key educational opportunities for all participants. The project includes developing courses and activities that will help undergraduates, graduate students, and professors learn evolutionary modeling methods.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, the PI has recruited three mentors to model the effects of developmental biases on morphological diversity: an engineer who models biological processes, a leading evolutionary developmental biologist who studies neural crest and cartilage development in amphibians, and an expert in phylogenetically based models of evolution. The scientist and the engineer will work together in cross-disciplinary courses to gain complementary expertise and train CSU students. They will adapt models of cartilage growth to explore the extent to which cell size, density, and local chemical environments influence ear development and also which cell-cell or cell-environment interactions could alter morphology. These models will generate testable predictions that will guide experiments in collaboration with the evolutionary developmental biologist and will be incorporated into an explicit evolutionary framework under the guidance of the phylogenetic modeler. In addition to the educational opportunities for the PI and graduate students, another outcome of this work will be a publicly available module to better teach evolutionary biology in large introductory biology classes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
