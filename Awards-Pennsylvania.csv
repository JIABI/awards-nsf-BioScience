Within this century rising sea water will affect 5% of the global population living along the coastline and 10% of the global gross domestic product. When combined with projected coastal wetland loss, rising sea levels will make communities more susceptible to flooding and economic disruptions.  Over the past decade, as coastal scientists have observed signs of increasing decline in coastal wetlands and maritime forests of the U.S. Northeast, the goal of coastal restoration projects has shifted almost completely towards adaptation to sea level rise. Coastal marshes play a key role in mitigating these effects of sea level rise but are themselves vulnerable to rising water. Fundamental research is needed to understand how sea level rise affects marshes and adjacent coastal areas and what can be done to make them more resilient. This EAGER award will provide novel and important insights into the processes responsible for coastal marsh die-off and potential mechanisms to enhance marsh resilience through expansion into adjacent forests and fields. Through field sampling and remote sensing this award will measure the means by which sea water rise affects both the marsh and adjacent forests and fields. An important and creative component of the research is the engagement of under-represented groups through the creation of a mentoring network focused on the proposed research.<br/><br/>This award has high potential for producing a transformative understanding of the effects of sea level rise on the resilience of coastal marsh systems in the northeastern US. Through a novel combination of insitu assessment of hydrologic stressors and remote sensing geospatial analyses, the award will assess the proximate hydrologic and ecological causes and consequences of sea level rise. By combining new technology (e.g., UAV flights, low cost pressure transducers, GEOBIA, machine learning algorithms), the research will provide a new understanding of how hydrologic factors drive coastal habitat transitions, which can provide important information on how interventions can be applied successfully to conserve coastal habitats for wildlife and flood mitigation values. In addition to understanding the factors responsible for marsh die off, a particularly unique aspect of this EAGER award is understanding the hydrologic and biogeochemical mechanisms by which transgression of the marsh into adjacent terrestrial systems occurs. The research takes a robust approach to understanding the temporal and spatial scales over which these processes occur. This award will develop an innovative mentoring network framework to engage under-served students in estuarine research. By taking a near-peer cohort approach to training the students will benefit from immersive funded research experiences and a supportive research community. The expansive training plan includes professional workshops, education workshops, and other professional enhancement activities (annual professional meetings, participation in professional networks).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of gene expression from modern genomic sequencing technologies requires the use of sophisticated software such as read mappers, transcript assemblers, and expression abundance estimators. A software program implementing one of these steps typically has a large number of user-settable parameters that influence how the analysis algorithm performs.  Scientists,biologists, and clinical researchers must often tune these parameters by hand or through other ad hoc means. The goal of this project is to automate this process by designing and implementing a framework for automatically learning high-performing parameters for gene expression analysis software. This project also aims to develop algorithms, software, and methodology to make this framework practical and useful. This will allow more researchers to obtain high-quality gene expression analyses with significantly less effort and will also enable improved analysis of large data sets where per-sample parameter tuning by hand is impractical. Reproducibility of biological results will also be enhanced since the choice of parameters is explicitly ceded to an automated, repeatable process. This research will make biological studies involving gene expression more accurate and less costly. A number of educational and outreach activities for various levels of students (elementary through undergraduate) are planned to enhance community understanding of gene expression and its analysis.<br/><br/>The developed processes will be implemented in several wrapper tools for parameter optimization that can be dropped into existing RNA-seq analysis pipelines to improve accuracy at each step.  The research to design these tools will be broken down into several more tractable steps. The first step will be learning, for each tool, a collection of representative parameter vectors by analyzing large collections of existing RNA-seq samples. In the second step, machine learning methods, based on a combination of techniques such as Bayesian Optimization, genetic algorithms, and classification approaches, will be used to design techniques to select parameter vectors from these sets that are predicted to offer high performance. In the third step, techniques for providing human-interpretable rationales for the automatic parameter choices will be designed and implemented. The design of this system will also enhance our practical knowledge of techniques for such parameter optimization in other application domains within biology.

In part, this may be because pathogens are usually studied in isolation. An alternative approach is to consider emerging pathogens as members of an ecological community of interacting microbes. The community ecology of viruses co-occurring in hosts -- the virome -- has yet to be explored as an ecological community even though viruses are known to be important emerging disease agents. The research supported by this award will address this deficiency by focusing on the viromes living inside two widespread species that live in close association with humans: the white footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis).  Blacklegged ticks feed abundantly on white-footed mice, and the two species freely exchange microbes during the lengthy blood meals.  By exploring how the viromes of these two species are assembled and how they interact and flow between mice and ticks, the proposed research will reveal how viromes shape transmission of existing and potential pathogens. The research will be carried out in the northeast corridor of the United States, an area known to be an excellent location for studying virus emergence and the role played by white-footed mice and blacklegged ticks in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens (those transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans).  White-footed mice and blacklegged ticks serve as reservoir host and vector, respectively, of many emerging diseases of humans, including Lyme disease. Pilot studies have revealed that these same two species also harbor a community of previously undescribed viruses that may emerge as zoonotic diseases in the future. <br/><br/>The researchers take an explicitly ecological approach to understanding viromes of reservoir and vector hosts. The researchers will: (1) characterize the viromes of both mouse and tick; (2) determine patterns of virome assembly throughout the lifetimes of both mouse and tick; (3) determine how virus communities affect the transmission of several important vector borne zoonotic pathogens; (4) identify whether viromes affect differences between individual mice and ticks in their abilities to transmit known and new pathogens; and (5) determine whether viromes and transmission probabilities change along with changing abundance of mice and between suburban/urban and more rural habitats. Data generated by each of these specific aims will be modeled using statistical (machine learning) algorithms, which accommodate diverse data types and apply a model-free analytical approach. By using complex and high-dimensional empirical data describing hosts, vectors, viromes, and their shared natural environments, these algorithms can achieve superior pattern detection  (such as virome composition) and improved ability to make useful predictions (such as what combinations of traits of vector viromes and mammal hosts best predict virus transmission)."

Natural scientists have built our understanding of the physical world. The scientific understanding they built has contributed to the development of technologies and practices that benefit human economies. For example, genetic sequencing of DNA enables deeper understanding of biological organisms; the consequences for human health, food production, understanding of evolutionary adaptation, etc. have been revolutionary and are still unfolding. The DNA sequence is the blueprint for an organism's anatomical structure (morphology) and function, but images capturing morphology are now much less prevalent than genetic data. Museums and researchers have been creating 3D digital images of natural history collections, and there are extensive 3D image data sets for some model organisms, but these data are mostly in closed collections, and generally unavailable or very difficult to access. This project aims to provide infrastructure to increase the accessibility of anatomical information, with a focus on 3D images. The resource will create the first open access, web-enabled image archive accepting and serving high-resolution, 3D scans of all organisms, called MorphoSource. Standardized descriptive tags will allow scientists to use this database to easily combine genetic and anatomical datasets for the first time, supporting the formulation of novel research questions. MorphoSource will link to other databases (such as iDigBio [www.idigbio.org]) that aggregate information on museum specimens from around the world. Having a shared common resource will change the culture among researchers and museums, making collaborations between physically distant experts more feasible, but it will also open the linked research collections of museums to anyone with Internet access anywhere in the world.  Large data sets are prerequisites for many statistical and machine learning methods, so the resource will enable innovations in computational image analysis methods, fostering new types of collaborations that advance field-wide scientific understanding. The resource will track data use, enhancing reproducibility and also providing an objective metric of the value of individual data elements. Open access to the data linked through MorphoSource will enable anyone with Internet access to see the detailed anatomical evidence for theories like evolution.  Pilot work has shown that teachers and students eagerly consume this newly available information, with numbers already in the thousands.  Positive results of this access include (1) providing a more intuitive type of raw data (compared to DNA sequence) for showing the public why some conclusions about evolutionary relationships were reached, (2) providing an 'interest metric' for the value of natural history museums and the collections they hold, (3) increasing the community of people (including citizen scientists) who have access to the data required to make important discoveries by studying biological variation. <br/><br/>The specific plan for creating the repository for 3D data on all organisms is as follows. The primary goal is to restructure and improve a proof of concept database called MorphoSource. The restructuring will allow MorphoSource to meet the needs of a growing community of researchers and educators through massive upscaling, and to implement a novel approach for economically preserving data for the long term. To accomplish this, the MorphoSource server will be rebuilt to use the Fedora digital asset management architecture, which has been developed by library scientists to serve emerging needs related to the archiving and sharing of digital data. As part of this architecture upgrade, the data hosted on MorphoSource will be given an additional layer of protection through managing asynchronous copies in DuraCloud, a digital data preservation platform that leverages Amazon cloud. This restructuring will allow the MorphoSource server architecture to be integrated with the Duke University Libraries repository infrastructure. MorphoSource will also be able to invite institutional communities to be consortium partners in support of data storage and to enact data preservation techniques that guarantee integrity and readability for the foreseeable future. Additional tools will (1) allow for rapid, automated ingestion of dozens to hundreds of datasets at once, (2) link MorphoSource with major biodiversity archives, and (3) provide in-browser visualization of 3D series of image slices, such as those generated by CT and MRI scanners.  The plan includes ingesting thousands of high quality legacy CT datasets from published studies, enabling their reuse, increasing the repeatability of studies. The project leaders plan to directly work with and design tools for K-12 educators and students to help them benefit from this resource. These datasets and educational tools will be available to researchers and the public through the updated MorphoSource website, available at www.morphosource.org."

However, these organisms exhibit more limited physiological responses to light and nutrients than many more complex cyanobacteria, which are often considered to be more difficult to study. The concept behind this project is ""to let nature be the guide"" to study photosynthesis in stressful settings in situ and to understand those photosynthetic processes identified mechanistically by using laboratory model organisms, genetics, biochemistry and biophysics. By learning more about adaptation and acclimation in cyanobacteria, it should be possible to develop strategies to improve photosynthetic efficiency in crop plants. The recently discovered capacity of some cyanobacteria to use far-red light for oxygenic photosynthesis raises questions about how those cyanobacteria are able to expand their usage of the solar spectrum reaching Earth's surface. This project will use genetic systems that have been developed for non-model cyanobacteria that exhibit diverse adaptive and acclimation responses. Genetic methods, together with physiological, biochemical and biophysical approaches will be used to study the photosynthetic apparatus in these organisms. This proposal offers a unique opportunity to expand knowledge of 'real-world' photosynthesis and is likely to provide new insights for engineering photosynthetic organisms intelligently for human needs, including expanding the light-use capabilities of crop plants. This project will provide training for underrepresented minorities in STEM research and education. The developed photobioreactor concept for the classroom will be used to involve K-12 level students in STEM education.   <br/><br/><br/>The defining premise of this project is that terrestrial cyanobacteria have evolved novel adaptive and acclimation responses to optimize light harvesting and energy trapping in environments with strongly filtered (e.g., far-red) light, variable redox states, and the intensive energetic demands of nitrogen fixation. Many cyanobacteria have a cluster of 17 genes encoding core subunits of Photosystem I (PSI), PSII, and phycobilisomes. Combined with the synthesis of chlorophylls (Chls) f and d, the products of these genes confer an acclimation response that permits growth in far-red light (700 to 800 nm), a process known as FaRLiP. This project will use the genetic system developed in Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 9212 to dissect FaRLiP and other postulated acclimation and adaptive responses by determining role of different genes and their variants in acclimation responses of PSI and their roles under anoxic, nitrogen-fixing conditions. This project will also characterize the energy transfer and trapping kinetics in PSI and PSII complexes and study long-wavelength-absorbing phycobiliproteins from cells undergoing FaRLiP and other adaptation/acclimation responses by performing genetic analyses and manipulations, biochemical analyses, mass spectrometry/proteomics, site-specific mutagenesis, biophysical methods (EPR spectroscopy, time-resolved optical spectroscopy).

By learning the principles underlying these mechanical motions, researchers will be able to better engineer enzymes to speed up desired chemical reactions under desired conditions. This research will also provide scientific training opportunities to students from historically underrepresented groups.

This research will uncover the interaction networks important for enzyme function to provide an understanding of how these networks guide the internal motions of enzymes. The model system that will be studied is tryptophan synthase, whose alpha and beta subunits catalyze the final two steps in tryptophan amino acid biosynthesis. The interaction networks are proposed to be important both for individual enzyme function and inter-subunit communication. The networks will be delineated by a combination of protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and bioinformatics analyses of protein sequences. The project will also manipulate these networks and enzyme function by targeting surface-exposed, network amino acid residues through mutagenesis and covalent modification.

Thus, elucidating what they do and how they work (i) informs how organisms from bacteria to humans adapt to environmental changes and sustain life, and (ii) provides design rules for engineering ""optogenetic"" protein tools for controlling cellular function with light. The overall goal of this CAREER Award is to reveal novel mechanisms and applications of light/oxygen/voltage (LOV) photoreceptor signaling in natural and engineered systems, through a unified research and educational program at the interface of photobiology, synthetic biology, and bioengineering.<br/><br/>This project will establish the signaling function and signal transmission mode of LOV proteins with regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) as their ontological effectors. The existence of RGS-LOV has been hypothesized based on bioinformatics but never proven by biochemical and biophysical characterization. Preliminary data suggests that the light-driven structural rearrangements unmask a membrane localization sequence, which enhances protein-protein interaction between the RGS and its G-alpha signaling partner to terminate G-protein coupled receptor signaling upon translocation. RGS-LOV structure-function relationships and functional signaling activity will be studied (i) in vitro using purified recombinant protein produced in bacteria and (ii) using cellular assays in heterologously expressing mammalian cells, as assessed by spectroscopy, immunohistochemistry, and high-resolution microscopy. Neither light-induced membrane localization nor the functional separation between regulators of G-proteins and light-gated membrane localization in one protein has been observed among natural LOV proteins. The research will impact broad research communities through the dissemination of optogenetic tools and open-source hardware. Educational activities will extend LOV photobiology studies and application into undergraduate research and STEM training, through activities that focus on hands-on learning and combining wet laboratory experience with mathematical models of biological signaling."

Importantly, the distributed nature of data generation in biology makes this situation even more challenging. Today one can hardly find a research institution or university without multiple high-throughput DNA sequencing machines, and there are often references to a ""data crisis"" in biology. Federal agencies, and the NSF in particular, are investing heavily in cyberinfrastructure by supporting development of high performance computing (HPC) resources such as the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE). Yet to a large extent, these resources remain unknown to biological researchers who overwhelmingly continue to rely on fragile in-house computation. The goal of this project is to ensure effective utilization of federal funds that have been invested into development of the national computing infrastructure. This project will extend the Galaxy software platform to leverage existing NSF hardware resources, increasing the value of existing infrastructure for biology researchers that were previously unable to take full advantage of these resources.<br/><br/>This project will follow a comprehensive approach that addresses the needs of experimental scientists, tool developers, and administrators of high performance compute systems (HPC). Access to national compute infrastructure will be expanded so that Galaxy will function as a middleware interface to existing heterogeneous environments such as XSEDE or individual systems such as Jetstream. Software components necessary to optimize Galaxy as a link between researchers and existing HPC will be developed based on pilot projects with the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), XSEDE, PSC, and Indiana University. (2) XSEDE resources to enable interactive data exploration and visualization will be leveraged to expand Galaxy's current capacity for dynamic scientific data analysis.  Integration with Interactive Analysis Environments, such as Jupyter or RStudio will allow manipulation and creation of Galaxy datasets using common scripting languages. Taking advantage of XSEDE resources will enable Galaxy's interactive environments and visual analytics to scale to large datasets and sophisticated workflows. (3) Sustainable training and outreach will focus on creating and disseminating curricula that enable investigators to learn skills needed to analyze large datasets. Creation of pre-configured infrastructure components for running workshops and develop modules for undergraduate and graduate face-to-face and on-line classes will expand the current educational portfolio to scale support for increasing numbers of Galaxy users, including disciplines beyond life sciences such as Natural Language Processing.

They are composed of many types of lipids and are crowded with numerous transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins. These proteins participate in all vital cellular processes, including biogenesis, energy and signal transduction, molecular transport, vesicular trafficking, cell motility, recognition, adhesion, and shape regulation. Despite the growing number of atomic structures of membrane proteins, the lack of information about their spatial positions and protein-lipid interactions in their native membranes impedes our understanding of molecular mechanisms of their folding, stability, function, and regulation. Motivated by rising demands in realistic representation of proteins in non-planar and deformable membranes with natural lipid compositions, we propose a creation of a high-capacity cyberinfrastructure for fast and reproducible assembly of membrane proteins with natural lipids to build flexible multicomponent biomembranes for subsequent structural analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This project will promote synergy between scientific research and education by training computer science students in developing bioinformatics resources, by using the developed toolbox for teaching, and by providing training materials and web-based workshops for students and the user community to promote research experience in membrane simulations.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will enhance and combine capabilities of the highly recognized and widely used PPM/OPM and CHARMM-GUI resources that have been developed by the research teams from the University of Michigan and Lehigh University. The project has three main components. First, the PPM (Positioning of Proteins in Membranes) method will be advanced for calculating the spatial arrangement and binding energy of proteins in deformable membranes characterized by diverse polarity profiles, asymmetry, charge, and curvature. Second, a new PPM/CHARMM-GUI toolbox will be developed by integrating the improved PPM method and CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder to assemble native-like protein-lipid systems and provide input files for realistic simulations of biomembranes by various MD simulation packages. The open web-based platform will allow users of diverse expertise to easily setup and perform simulations of membrane proteins with known three-dimensional (3D) structures in deformable membranes with complex lipid composition.

This arrangement would allow the pollen produced by the anther to land on the top of the pistil to result in self-pollination and consequent inbreeding.  Inbreeding is deleterious to any organism, as it causes reduced fitness in progeny.  Flowering plants have adopted self-incompatibility (SI), which allows the pistil to reject self-pollen to prevent inbreeding, but accept non-self pollen to promote outcrossing.  Since Charles Darwin first documented this phenomenon in a monograph published in 1876, SI has attracted the interest of a wide spectrum of biologists.  The PI has identified a pistil protein and 17 pollen proteins that are key players in mediating SI in Petunia inflata, a wild relative of garden petunia.  In this project, the PI and his collaborator will use a combination of molecular, biochemical, genetic, genomic, and structural approaches to determine how the 17 pollen proteins and a single pistil protein work together to allow the pistil to specifically reject self-pollen.  The results have wider implications for the study of many other biological systems employing self/non-self recognition.  The genes for these proteins could be used to facilitate hybrid-seed production, which, if accomplished, would provide tremendous agronomic benefits.  The PI will engage graduate and undergraduate students in this project to prepare them for future research careers, and will offer summer research opportunity for high school students through Penn State's Upward Bound Math and Science Program. <br/><br/>In S-RNase-based self-incompatibility in Petunia inflata, the polymorphic S-locus controls the outcome of pollination; matching of the pollen S-haplotype with either S-haplotype of the pistil results in growth inhibition of pollen tubes.  The PI has shown that the S-RNase gene controls pistil specificity and identified 17 S-locus F-box (SLF) genes in S2-haplotype that collectively control pollen specificity.  In this project, the PI will complete the determination of 187 interaction relationships between all 17 SLF proteins and 11 allelic variants of S-RNase.  These results will be used to study the biochemical basis of differential interactions between SLF proteins and S-RNases, and select SLF/S-RNase pairs for X-ray structural study of the interactions.  Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones collectively containing the S-RNase and 17 SLF genes have been isolated, sequenced, and assembled, totaling ~3.1 Mbp.  To fill gaps in the S-locus sequence, additional BAC clones will be isolated and sequenced.  The PI has shown that all 17 SLF proteins form similar SCF complexes, but the Cullin1 and Skp1 components (PiCUL1-P and PiSSK1) are pollen-specific.  The effect of knockout and suppressed expression of PiCUL1-P and PiSSK1 will be examined, and the X-ray structure of the SCFSLF complex will be determined.  The PI has found that SLF proteins themselves are subject to ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the 26S proteasome, and identified proteins that may be involved in regulating the dynamics of the SCFSLF complex.  The role of these proteins will be examined.  All X-ray crystallization experiments will be performed in the lab of the collaborator."

Back in their classrooms, implementation of this new content will engage middle and high school students with current scientific progress and its connection to their everyday lives. Emulsions where droplets of one phase are suspended in another liquid phase are common in consumer products such as salad dressings or sunscreens, and can be used to illustrate fundamental principles in multiple disciplines including chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology, and food science. The Principal Investigator and graduate students will also aid in development of chemistry content for a K-12 education approach being developed by colleagues in the Education department to facilitate high-level science comprehension.<br/><br/>Liquid-liquid phase coexistence, which causes biomolecule-rich aqueous droplets termed coacervates to form in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells, has only recently been realized as a pervasive organizational motif for membraneless organelles, and is not yet well understood. This project will provide new insight into physicochemical driving forces underlying intracellular organization by liquid-liquid phase coexistence, as well as potential consequences of coexisting peptide-rich phases for biochemical reactions. Non-uniform solute distribution between coexisting phase compartments (coacervate droplets) will impact the rates of biochemical reactions, providing a mechanism to control reaction rates via droplet formation and dissolution. Post-translational modifications, specifically phosphorylation and methylation events in intrinsically disordered regions of key proteins, are thought to be a major mechanism for regulating the formation and dissolution of membraneless organelles. This project will use serine phosphorylation and arginine methylation to control phase separation in peptide-based model systems, as a means of regulating the rates of enzymatic reactions. This project has three research objectives: (1) Evaluate mechanisms for reaction control by droplet formation/dissolution. (2) Develop biomimetic peptide coacervate system that responds to arginine methylation. (3) Evaluate the hypothesis that spatial and temporal occurrence of distinct droplet phases can be controlled by different post-translational modifications, and provides a means of selectively modulating enzymatic reactions."

Proteins destined for destruction are tagged with a chain composed of multiple copies of a small protein called ubiquitin. In this project, the principal investigator, together with undergraduate and master's students,  will investigate how ubiquitin chains affect the ability of the proteasome to unfold the attached target protein. The proteasome is a central player in many aspects of cellular function, so better understanding of its mechanism, and why some proteins are degraded and others are spared, will benefit many scientists who study these cellular processes. Many undergraduate and master's students will work on this project, and, through their intellectual investment, will increase their critical thinking and scientific inquiry skills, which will serve them well as they go on to careers in medicine, industry, academia or other fields. The PI will work with Villanova's Academic Advancement program to excite underrepresented students about doing research while in college. The PI will also work to disseminate a project-based course for biochemistry majors that gives students a taste of real research.<br/><br/>The proteasome is a macromolecular machine inside every eukaryotic cell that unfolds and degrades proteins destined for disposition.  The proteasome therefore, impacts nearly all biological processes by controlling the concentration of hundreds of proteins in a cell, and so is foundational to understanding cellular biology. Despite the proteasome?s centrality, questions remain concerning proteasome function. The overall goal of the research conducted in the principal investigator's laboratory is to understand the molecular determinants of the proteasome's ability to unfold proteins. It is generally thought that if a protein is targeted to the proteasome via polyubiquitination, that protein is degraded. However, sometimes proteins are incompletely degraded, leading to protein fragments with new or even toxic functions. It is not fully understood when or why incomplete degradation occurs. In earlier NSF-funded research, the PI showed that the polyubiquitin chain attached to a substrate protein increases the ability of the proteasome to unfold the substrate protein and that proteasomal ubiquitin receptors mediate this activation. However, the mechanism remains unknown. In this project, the PI will determine (1) how the ubiquitin chain architecture affects the proteasome's ability to unfold a substrate, (2) how proteasome-associated proteins, in combination with ubiquitin receptors, influence the proteasome's unfolding ability and (3) how binding to ubiquitin receptors is communicated to the proteasomal motor proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The machinery that accomplishes animal cell cytokinesis is known as the contractile ring and it consists of a transiently assembled belt of cytoskeletal proteins which generates the force required to divide the cell. Employing a variety of imaging technologies in combination with computational modeling, this project will test the hypothesis that in animal cells the contractile ring assembles from nodes of contractile proteins that aggregate into a functional contractile assemblage. The resulting increase in knowledge of the architecture and dynamics of the contractile ring derived from this project will have significant impacts on research in the fields of cell proliferation, movement, shape change, as well as differentiation and development. This project will train students from a four-year liberal arts college (Dickinson College) and a minority-serving research university (New Mexico State University), who will work not only at their respective institutions but also collaboratively at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories (FHL). A computational modeler with experience in agent-based modeling of cytoskeletal protein dynamics will provide training in agent-based modeling. Lastly, the investigators will engage in a number of activities that will broaden the impact of the project through the broadening of participation of URM students, the integration of research and education, and public engagement and improvement of science literacy. <br/><br/>The aims of this project will test the hypothesis that the contractile ring assembles from nodes comprised of the cytoskeletal proteins myosin II, actin, septins and anillin, which then congress into a mature contractile machine that generates the force necessary for cytokinesis. This node-based mode of ring assembly occurs in fission yeast, but had never been demonstrated in higher order animals cells until the investigators described the presence of node-like structures in the early contractile rings of sea urchin embryos. Using this report as a foundation, the investigators will apply super resolution, electron, and live cell microscopy to examine node composition, assembly and aggregation during cytokinesis in sea urchin and sea star embryos. Using empirical data as well as existing models for yeast node congression, two- and three-dimensional, agent-based models will be tested in silico, and results from these simulations will be used to inform further experimentation. Lastly, these approaches will be applied to the study of polar lobe formation, which uses a contractile ring-like structure that forms during cytokinesis in many early embryos, but whose composition and spatiotemporal regulation may be quite different from a standard contractile ring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While most people can swing a hammer, it takes thousands of hours of practice to become a master carpenter who can swing a hammer with fluid speed and precision.   This process of long-term improvement in movement accuracy is known as skill acquisition, and is presumably driven by coordinated changes in our brain's neural representation of the movement.  Yet despite the bedrock importance of skill learning in our daily lives, the link between neural reorganization and skill acquisition is still largely unknown. This CAREER proposal lays the foundation for a long-term integrated research and educational program that will discover the links between cortical reorganization and skill acquisition and determine the behavioral factors that drive skill learning.  An improved understanding of the science behind skill learning will have long-term impact on our clinical understanding of the progression of various motor control disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and stroke, and may inform the design of targeted rehabilitation paradigms and brain-computer interface systems for those patient groups.  <br/><br/>Learning is a fundamental principle of brain operation that impacts every aspect of neural function.  Long-term practice has been accompanied by a reorganization of cortical activity in a number of brain areas, but it is typically only imaged at the level of millions of neurons. The research proposed here will explicitly probe how changes in the properties of individual neurons are linked to skill acquisition.  To accomplish this goal, this proposal leverages a brain-computer interface (BCI) skill learning task that enables precise investigation into the links between neural activity and behavioral improvement. With a BCI, it is possible to create a mapping between the activity of neurons and the movement of a computer cursor. To achieve dexterous control of the cursor, BCI subjects must practice with a particular neuron-to-cursor mapping to learn how to structure their neural activity to achieve desired movements.  We will train Rhesus macaques to operate BCIs and give them new skills to master by presenting them with new BCI mappings.  We will then track the reorganization in neural activity that occurs over days and weeks as they gain skilled control of the device. Critically, these mappings will be tailored to test various hypotheses about the behavioral drivers (i.e., visuomotor error, visuomotor bias, and movement efficiency) of cortical reorganization. The results of this study will thus provide an unparalleled view into the neural instantiation of skill development over its entire time course."

Understanding the structures of large individual macromolecules and their complexes inside cells is fundamental to biological research community. However, such structural information has been extremely difficult to obtain due to the lack of data acquisition techniques. Recent advances in cellular electron cryo-tomography (CECT) have enabled 3D imaging of cellular structure and organization at sub-molecular resolution and in near-native state. CECT images contain tens of millions of structurally highly diverse macromolecules, which introduces a major challenge in the throughput of subsequent computational analysis. How to efficiently and accurately process the images to identify each distinct type of macromolecular complex has been challenging. Conventional methods that try to align and classify each type of complex are too slow to process the large volumes of data being acquired. This project will focus on reducing data annotation costs using supervised deep learning, which is a major bottleneck for macromolecule structural recognition. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in computational biology, bioinformatics, and bioimage analysis, as well integrate research results into university curricula.<br/><br/>The project will develop novel approaches to significantly reduce the training data annotation cost. This will be achieved by (1) improving the generalization ability of classification model trained by randomizing the simulated imaging conditions;  (2) enhancing training of classification model using structural representation learned from unlabeled subtomograms via a semi-supervised autoencoder; and (3) reducing annotation by selecting the minimal set of most important subtomograms for improving the classification using active learning. By integrating the three objectives into a unified system, this project will provide users learning-based subtomogram classification models with improved accuracy and a minimal amount of annotated training data. The success of the project is a critical step towards fully automating the systematic in situ macromolecule structural classification in single cells captured by heterogeneous CECT datasets. The algorithms and software developed in this project will have direct benefit to the structural biology community. To facilitate broad use of the methods developed from this project, an open-source CECT analysis software, AITom (https://github.com/xulabs/aitom), will be developed.

Of interest to the principal investigator of this project is the ability of stress to impair sustained attention, the process of monitoring situations for rare and unpredictably occurring events. Adequately sustaining attention is critical for accurately performing more complex cognitive tasks.  Therefore, disruptions in sustained attention as a result of stress can lead to widespread cognitive impairments. Surprisingly, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the effect of stress on this type of attention are unknown. This project addresses this gap in knowledge by using behavioral, neuroanatomical, and molecular approaches to test how a specific stress-related chemical signal, corticotropin releasing factor, regulates the brain circuitry required for sustained attention in male and female rats. The results from this research will greatly advance our understanding of the interactions between the brain systems involved in stress and attention. These findings thereby may lay the groundwork for the development of strategies aimed at improving cognition during stressful events. In addition to the scientific work, this project includes an education plan designed to improve student learning outcomes for Temple University's diverse undergraduate population and create public resources for improving the teaching of college courses in the ""flipped-classroom"" format, in which students first learn new material outside of class and then use class time to work on exercises with classmates and the instructor.<br/><br/>Studies have examined how stress modulates learning, the neurobiological mechanisms by which stress modulates attention remain underexplored. Recently, the principal investigator of this project demonstrated that sustained attention is disrupted by central infusions of the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in male and female rats. Sustained attention is known to be mediated by the basal forebrain.  Therefore, this project examines how CRF regulates the basal forebrain from the systems to the molecular levels. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CRF directly modulates the basal forebrain to disrupt sustained attention by combining pharmacological manipulations and a well-validated attention task. Aim 2 is to uncover the circuitry by which CRF can impact basal forebrain neurons by using retrograde tracing, cell-type specific markers, and measures of neuronal activation. Aim 3 is to identify molecular changes induced by CRF in cholinergic basal forebrain neurons by using Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting in combination with next generation sequencing. The findings will improve our fundamental understanding of how stress affects cognition. The rich sequencing data resulting from this work is an important resource for researchers studying attention circuits, and is to be made publicly available for use by other investigators. The project's education plan is designed to improve the flipped-classroom format by developing special assignments that emphasize cognitive and metacognitive techniques to promote active engagement with the out-of-class material. These assignments are made available through public media and their efficacy is examined experimentally.  The insights gained from the educational plan are to be published in education journals."

They do this by arranging algae within their tissues into vertical pillars parallel to incoming sunlight. The surface of the tissue is covered by cells called iridocytes; these function to redistribute light incident on the horizontal surface of the clam tissue evenly over the much larger vertical surfaces of the algal micropillars.

Co-PI Yang will make new materials inspired by the clam by synthesizing top-down and bottom-up design and fabrication techniques to rival biology in hierarchical structural control. The clam's design will be especially useful for utilizing inexpensive polymer photovoltaics efficiently and with low photodamage in novel devices, and for improved photobioreactor technology.

A clearer understanding of the relationship between climate and host-pathogen interactions is needed to predict and mitigate the risks that infectious diseases pose to humans and wildlife. The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) causes the disease chytridiomycosis, which has been linked to declines and extinctions of frogs worldwide and appears to be an important contributor to the ongoing amphibian extinction crisis.

Normally, the genome is compacted by winding the DNA around barrel-like cores of proteins. Tight packaging turns genes off, but chemical modification of the protein cores can relax the DNA and allow genes to be turned on.  The modifications are carried out by a large group of enzymes, but how and where they function remains unknown. This project will take an interdisciplinary approach, including organic chemistry, protein engineering, and cell biology--to uncover the specificity of these modifiers and to design enzymes capable of turning on specific genes at will. The research setting will provide a unique training ground for graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, a chemical biology laboratory course will engage undergraduate students in inquiry-based exercises where students will learn to design and carry out real-world experiments aimed at developing their critical thinking and independent learning skills.  Early implementation of such a research-based course is expected to bridge a gap existing in the current educational curriculum by motivating STEM students in science education and research with the long-term benefit of generating a skilled workforce.<br/><br/>Changes in gene expression in eukaryotic organisms like humans can be achieved by reversible chemical modifications on the histone protein components of chromatin.  The focus of this project is to study a particular type of modification, called lysine methylation, which is removed by a class of enzymes known as lysine demethylases. How specific demethylases contribute to gene expression has remained largely unexplored, due in part to the lack of tools capable of rapidly interrogating a given demethylase in intact cells under carefully controlled conditions. Using one particular lysine demethylase as paradigm, this research will focus on developing a novel chemical-genetic platform that combines pharmacological and genetic engineering to perturb specific isoforms with rationally designed small molecules and precise temporal control. Furthermore, the engineered demethylation apparatus will be combined with the spatial selectivity of programmable CRISPR-Cas9 to develop a new type of conditional epigenome editing tool for regulating gene transcription in space and time. The approach will be applied to reprogram expression of genes that underlie faithful cell division, cellular differentiation, lineage commitment, and ultimately, organismal development. These unique tools will be made broadly available to researchers interested in addressing how reversible histone methylation regulates eukaryotic biology.<br/><br/>This project is funded jointly by the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate of Biological Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program, Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key molecular element of this synaptic connection is the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR), a protein in the postsynaptic neuronal membrane that conducts electrical signals to deliver messages from the presynaptic neuron. This process of neurotransmission is modulated by a variety of auxiliary proteins that bind to glutamate receptors. This project will illuminate how different auxiliary proteins interact with the glutamate receptor and with each other to initiate and modulate communication between neurons.  This study enhances our knowledge of the molecular underpinnings of brain function. The research will involve undergraduate and graduate students, providing an educational environment and training opportunities at the forefront of brain research. Outreach activities involving local high schools and colleges are planned as well to promote diverse participation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>It is increasingly recognized that the majority of proteins operate in cells within dynamically formed and re-formed complexes. This is especially important for signaling receptor proteins, such as ionotropic receptors in the brain that conduct electrical current through postsynaptic membranes to facilitate fast communication between neurons. The AMPA receptors (AMPAR) - a subtype of iGluRs - mediate the fastest excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. Correspondingly, regulation of AMPAR trafficking, localization and function is the key mechanism determining synaptic strength and plasticity that underlies high cognitive brain functions, such as learning and memory. It has been discovered recently that synaptic AMPARs function as complexes with a multitude of auxiliary proteins. This project aims to characterize molecular interactions of AMPARs with the cys-knot AMPAR modulating proteins (CKAMPs) and their interplay with the transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs). A large collection of AMPAR and CKAMP mutants will be employed to identify interaction domains and specific residues involved in receptor regulation. Computational structural modeling including docking and molecular dynamics simulations will be employed to guide further determination of the protein-protein interfaces, which will be tested by electrophysiology experiments, and to generate and analyze candidate constructs for successful structure determination by cryo-EM. This collaborative effort, combining complementary approaches and continuous exchange of information and reagents, may provide the synergy needed to reach a new level of understanding of AMPAR regulation. In addition to providing fundamental insights into AMPAR gating and regulation, the results of this study will also serve as a roadmap for investigating AMPAR-mediated processes in synaptic physiology.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, and the Rules of Life Venture Fund.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, our understanding of guard cell function at the cellular and molecular levels is limited. This project studies how guard cells dynamically expand and shrink to open and close stomatal pores, controlling the uptake of carbon dioxide and the release of oxygen and water by the plant. Understanding how guard cells function will aid in the development of resilient, high-yielding crops that can grow in hot, dry environments and more effectively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The image analysis and modeling tools created in this project will allow researchers to predict the behavior of a wide range of mechanical behaviors and responses by cells. This multidisciplinary project will train three PhD students as future leaders across the topics of cell biology, computational image analysis, and mechanical testing and modeling of biological systems, and will spread knowledge of guard cells and plant biology using learning modules and research experiences for K-12 and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Despite decades of research interest, the molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which stomatal guard cells function remain incompletely understood. In particular, the roles of the cell wall and water flux in guard cells and neighboring cells in stomatal mechanics are not fully defined. This project combines molecular genetics, cell biology, advanced microscopy, computational image analysis, nanoindentation, and computational modeling to measure and model turgor pressure and wall mechanics in wild type and mutant stomatal complexes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These analyses will be used to examine the biomechanics of guard cells and the dynamic mechanical and functional relationships between guard cells and their neighboring cells. Another major goal of the project is to use super-resolution microscopy to develop a clear picture of the molecular composition and architecture of the guard cell wall, and to use these data to construct detailed, accurate, and experimentally testable finite element and multiscale, multiphysics models of stomatal guard cells. Together, this work will enable the prediction of stomatal dynamics across a range of species, wall compositions, stomatal geometries, and signaling inputs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stomata are small openings in the surfaces of plants that regulate the photosynthetic conversion of CO2 into plant biomass, which serves as a renewable source of food, materials, and bioenergy. A deeper understanding of cell wall structure, mechanics, and dynamics in stomatal guard cells will help identify plants that can more efficiently use water, a major limiting factor in global agricultural production. The computational image analysis and modeling tools that will be developed in this project will provide scientists with new ways of interpreting and understanding experimental data. Because stomatal guard cells are an amazing example of cellular engineering by plants and are accessible and observable by scientists of all ages, a learning module will be developed and deployed that allows 4th through 8th graders to observe stomatal dynamics first-hand and challenges them to construct and optimize functioning macro-scale models of stomatal guard cells, helping to inspire future scientists and engineers. This project will also train two PhD students and a research associate in interdisciplinary research skills that cross the boundaries of biology, computer and information science, and engineering.<br/><br/>In plants, stomatal guard cells function as dynamic gatekeepers that control CO2 and water flux to maintain homeostasis. To control transpiration and photosynthesis, stomatal development, morphology, and mechanics are tightly regulated. However, two large gaps exist in our knowledge of how stomata develop and function. First, stomatal pores form via controlled separation of sister guard cells, but how this is accomplished is unknown. Second, the walls of guard cells must be highly flexible to enable repeated stomatal opening and closing, but strong enough to withstand the enormous turgor pressure that drives their deformation. How guard cell walls are molecularly constructed to meet these competing requirements remains largely undefined. This project will analyze the molecular and mechanical requirements for stomatal pore formation, and the dynamic molecular architecture of guard cell walls that underlie their unique mechanical properties, using a complementary set of approaches including molecular genetics, high-resolution microscopy, and computational image analysis. The data and insights gained from these analyses will be used to construct computational mechanical models of guard cell walls that can be iteratively refined with new experimental results, ultimately resulting in the ability to predict guard cell dynamics across a range of species, wall compositions, and signaling inputs."

Implementation of dNHC-enabled online courses will engage hundreds to thousands of students at the introductory and advanced level. This approach is known to increase engagement, retention, and long-term success in undergraduates. Embedding research experiences in biology coursework is especially important for low income, first-generation, and minority undergraduate students who may be unable to dedicate time to research outside their normal course load due to personal and financial barriers. <br/><br/>This Rapid grant is dedicated to bringing together undergraduate educators, natural history collections professionals, data professionals, and collections researchers to support the development and implementation of online Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) using dNHC data for the 2020-2021 academic year. Extensive NSF-funded digitization of biological collections has created millions of specimen records on publicly-available data portals, resulting in unique and innovative opportunities for collections research. Using these resources in CUREs provides teaching and research opportunities to students and educators and requires only a computer, internet access, and time. Online CUREs using dNHCs are perfectly positioned to fill the gap in ecology and evolution research experiences as students lose access to laboratories and field sites. Teams of undergraduate educators and collections professionals will collaborate to develop teaching materials, course syllabi, and instructor guides to support the implementation of online dNHC CUREs in fall 2020 and beyond. This RAPID will recruit a diverse group of CURE developers and implementers and support members with collaboration and training opportunities. Faculty members who teach high proportions of underrepresented minorities and first-generation college students will be especially encouraged to participate, and resources created through this process will be widely disseminated to guide and support future dNHC CURE development.

When plants experience a dry spell, subsets of genes in the genome are turned off, or silenced, by a protein regulator called Polycomb. This silencing helps the plant conserve crucial resources to survive the drought. Some aspects of how Polycomb works to silence genes is understood, but exactly how Polycomb targets the correct genes to silence in response to drought is still a mystery. Following up on clues obtained from recent studies, this project will study a newly identified protein called PIR, which may provide the missing link between drought and Polycomb action. Understanding this connection could have broad impacts for agriculture, as the findings would help plant breeders develop crop varieties that can grow better in dry environments. The project will also have educational impact by improving structured active learning activities in classroom settings, in both introductory and advanced biology courses.  In addition, we will develop and disseminate research laboratory modules for engaging high school students in authentic research experiences. The educational activities are aimed at enhancing the success and retention of diverse groups of students in science and are expected to contribute to preparation of a future STEM workforce.<br/><br/>In plants and animals, Polycomb protein complexes have long been recognized as key developmental regulators and much is known about how they repress gene expression by histone modification and chromatin compaction. In contrast, less is understood about how these regulators control gene expression in response to exogenous cues.  This project will use the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to study how drought stress influences silencing through interaction of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) with another protein, called Polycomb Interacting Repressor (PIR). Preliminary results provided evidence that PIR is linked to drought stress response and that it interacts genetically and physically with PRC2.  These observations will be followed up to explore: how drought stress influences recruitment and activity of PIR/PRC2 complexes on chromatin; whether PIR functions as a non-stoichiometric auxiliary PRC2 component; and whether drought leads PIR, which is an intrinsically disordered protein, to form membrane-less phase-separated nuclear condensates, known as polycomb bodies.

Prior to the analysis of genomes of many animals, it was assumed that animals developed differently because they had different protein-coding genes.  It is now realized that even very different animals have similar sets of genes, and it is not the genes themselves, but how they are used during embryonic development, that lead to differences.  How those genes are used differently during development is poorly understood, however, and is important for understanding the types of changes in animal shape that can occur during evolution.  This proposal takes advantage of a clear example of a set of genes that have evolved a new function, i.e. to make a larval skeleton in the sea urchin, while most echinoderms (the group that includes the sea urchins) make a skeleton only in the adult animal.  What changes in gene regulation led to this basic new ability?  Many community resources will be generated including DNA sequences that will be shared on publically available databases such as NCBI and Echinobase.  This proposal will also train postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduates, including those from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in science.  The broader public will also be engaged in this research through a series of public lectures in Carnegie Mellon's Osher Lifelong Learning Institute and through outreach programs with local K-12 public schools. <br/><br/>The gene regulatory network (GRN) for the development of the sea urchin larval skeleton is very well known.  Other out-group echinoderm larvae have no or very reduced larval skeletons, yet all echinoderms make a skeleton after metamorphosis.  Prior evidence suggests that the sea urchin larval skeleton was co-opted from the GRN for the formation of this adult skeleton.  The first objective of this proposal is to determine the set of genes that have been co-opted from the adult skeletogenic program, and are differently expressed in the sea star mesoderm, which does not form a skeleton.  Differential RNA-Seq will be used to screen for potential genes in sea urchin, sea cucumbers, and a sea star.  Whole-mount in situ hybridization will be used to determine their spatial location.  The next objective is to understand how cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) can function in the new larval context and to understand the function of the subcircuits of the co-opted genes in larval sea urchins.  ChIP-Seq will identify CRMs and their associated genes.  Functional dissection of CRMs and perturbation of identified target genes that are shared targets will determine how these CRMs can function in both the original and new circuit, and also the types of trans environments, and subcircuit topologies that permit cooption.  This work will contribute to an understanding of the plasticity and evolvability of GRNs."

In order for RNAS to perform their specific functions in cells they often need to be processed by protein factors.  Protein processing is generally associated with structural changes that are very important to the processing protein function.  This research project will develop chemical-based methodologies to identify and characterize the protein structural elements that can regulate the activity and initial structural state of essential RNA processing proteins. The second objective of this research is to provide an effective training environment for students interested in RNA-protein research.  Undergraduate students will perform all investigations, including the synthesis and purification of all RNAs and proteins utilized in this study. To cultivate a rich learning environment, comprehensive multi-approach mentoring and Just-in-Time teaching of experimental research will be used. This mentoring infrastructure is designed to advance problem solving and critical thinking skills in experimental design and analysis, and it has been successful in the past. Thus, this project will not only further the understanding of protein regulation, but also provide a strong foundation for students in the sciences. <br/><br/>DEAD-box proteins constitute a large sub-class of putative unwindases essential in many RNA metabolic pathways. For example, Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing and assembly are highly regulated pathways requiring several DEAD-box proteins. This family of proteins couples cellular function to protein structural changes. In a subset of DEAD-box proteins, activity is mediated through additional peripheral elements/domains. The goal of this research is to understand the structural and thermodynamic nature of peripheral domain effects on the activity and conformational state of a model protein. Specifically, a DEAD-box protein model will be biochemically characterized and comparatively analyzed to evaluate the catalytic consequence of domain deletion variants. Equilibrium and kinetic methodologies will be developed to study the effects of initial conformations on nucleotide binding. Lastly, solvent-accessible and dynamic regions will be identified for the model system. Since the deregulation of the model protein and its human homolog has critical cellular consequences, the proposed research will further the understanding of (1) how DEAD-box proteins can bind early during processing and function in later events, and (2) how DEAD-box proteins and other RNA folding and processing accessory factors can utilize various conformations to regulate activity. Thus, the characterization of these states is important for any protein that utilizes ATP hydrolysis within a dynamic multi-factor complex."

The primary goal of this project is to use theoretical and experimental approaches to understand the network properties of neurons that can produce the extremely precise activity necessary to enable these actions. Such networks are likely to be wired during the development of the brain, but the precise mechanisms involved remain a mystery. Previous computational models and experimental observations suggest that the wiring process is gradual. The investigators of this project will study how individual neurons are incorporated into the network. Of particular interest are postnatally born neurons, which have more immature properties compared with other neurons within the circuit, including a higher degree of spontaneous activity, which potentially facilitates their recruitment into the network. These ideas will be tested by experimentally tagging and manipulating immature neurons, as well as by constructing computational models and simulating the network growth process. The findings may shed light on how functional neuronal networks develop.  The research may also help to formulate strategies of repairing dysfunctional or injured brain networks through manipulation of neuron maturity. This research will involve a wide range of innovative experimental and computational techniques and provide opportunities for students to gain expertise in electrophysiology, neural data analysis, and modern methods of computational neuroscience. The principal investigators will train postdoctoral researchers as well as graduate students, undergraduates, and summer high school interns. <br/><br/>The model system used in this project is the motor control circuitry of the zebra finch, a songbird whose adult courtship song consists of a highly repeatable sequence of vocal elements (or motif) sung with millisecond precision. The timing of song is controlled by a premotor forebrain region called HVC (proper name). Each premotor HVC neuron fires once per motif with sub-millisecond timing jitter across renditions. As a population, these neurons drive downstream song production circuits to produce specific acoustic patterns. During development, precise timing within HVC gradually emerges while the bird is learning to perform his song. Previous experimental observations suggest that neurons are gradually incorporated into the network generating song-relevant neural sequences, potentially from the newly born neurons that are robustly added to HVC during this period. This project aims to investigate the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying the development of the sequence generating network in HVC. The central hypothesis of this work is that these spontaneously active, newly born neurons are preferentially added to the leading edge of the growing timing network. This hypothesis will be tested with a combined experimental and computational modeling approach: (1) directly imaging the dynamics of network integration of newly born neurons in vivo through a targeted retroviral method; (2) constructing a computational model of HVC that is constrained by these observations and using the model to investigate the mechanisms of the network growth; and (3) measuring the cellular and synaptic properties of newly born neurons and their spontaneous activity as they mature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These voluminous data on variation are posing unexpected challenges to the (nearly) neutral theory of molecular evolution that explains the fate of new mutations in a population through random genetic drift and purifying selection.  The research team will employ  mechanistic models of epistasis, co-evolutionary processes, and deep learning.  Deep integration across disciplines will be key for exploring the pivotal role of epistasis and, ultimately, for interrogating the most fundamental rules of life. <br/><br/>The research team proposes a transdisciplinary project to set the foundations for a novel neutral-by-epistasis  theory of molecular evolution.  This team hypothesizes that a vast majority of population variation and species differences are due to random genetic drift of mutations that are neutral by epistasis, even though each may be individually detrimental.  The new neutral-by-epistasis theory unites both neutral and nearly-neutral theories of molecular evolution and has the potential for a paradigm shift in which epistatic interactions between positions, rather than any individual position are the primary unit of comparative analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hundreds of olfactory receptors are deployed to detect a vast array of chemicals with exquisite sensitivity in complex environments. This collaborative project combines biochemistry, neurobiology, genomics, mathematics and new technologies to understand how the mammalian olfactory system detects, encodes and extracts meaning from chemical stimuli. The goals of this project are to: (1) elucidate fundamental neural mechanisms for how chemical sensation turns into the perception of a smell; (2) produce a vast array of scientific resources to olfactory scientists; (3) provide valuable  information for broader audiences, including for molecular evolution, chemical ecology, and flavor and fragrance communities; (4) establish new technologies and mathematical frameworks to study biological systems; and (5) facilitate applied chemical sensing technologies for environmental monitoring, food safety, and homeland security.

Completion of the project entails the development and use a broad array of innovative approaches that include mapping all human and mouse odorant receptors to the chemicals they bind, defining the innate valence of these chemicals using behavioral assays, mapping all odorant receptor projections to the olfactory bulb, functionally characterizing their neural representations in the olfactory bulb and cortical amygdala, and using novel mathematical approaches to understand the underlying structure of odor coding and olfactory neural circuits at the level of sensory neurons, olfactory bulb glomeruli, and amygdala. Progress towards each aim involves close collaborations between team members with diverse expertise, including molecular biology, behavioral neuroscience, in vivo functional imaging, and mathematical and theoretical analysis of complex datasets.

Similar to other types of connections or so-called synapses between neurons, electrical synapses are known to undergo changes in strength.  However, the specific conditions that result in plasticity or changes in strength of electrical synapses are unknown. This project investigates the specific neuronal activity rules and underlying mechanisms whereby these synapses are modified by ongoing brain activity.  Further, this project aims to advance our understanding of how these activity-dependent modifications of electrical synapse strength impact brain function, in particular that processing of sensory information via the thalamus to the cortex. The findings will yield important new insights into the function of electrical synapses and their plasticity across the brain, and how the brain gates cortical attention to the sensory environment surrounding the organism.  The project involves a combination of brain research, undergraduate and graduate training in neuroscience concepts and research techniques, and educational development through special institutional programs aimed at disadvantaged children and youth, with a goal of public education and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM disciplines) by traditionally underrepresented students.<br/><br/> Learning rules and mechanisms for long-term synaptic modification have been described extensively for neurotransmitter-based synapses. However, strikingly little is yet known about activity-dependent plasticity of electrical synapses, also known as gap junctions. Because electrical synapses are widespread but their importance in mammalian brain function, it is critical that we advance our understanding of whether and how these types of essential synapses are regulated in a use-dependent manner.  The central hypothesis of this project is that the strength of electrical synapses in the thalamic reticular nucleus, the major inhibitory regulator of cortico-thalamic communication, is continuously updated by activity in electrically coupled neurons; in turn, this plasticity alters the synchrony within and the inhibitory output of the thalamic reticular nucleus. To test this hypothesis, the control and the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity is investigated using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetic techniques. Aim 1 examines the mechanisms that underlie plasticity of electrical synapses, with the goal of elucidating and developing predictions about the relationship between activity and synaptic strength. Aim 2 measures the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity on synchrony within networks of coupled thalamic neurons, and thereby offers new insight into the inhibition that coupled interneurons deliver to their downstream targets. Aim 3 tests the functional role of electrical synapse plasticity in brain rhythms and network plasticity.  Together, the studies will lead to novel understanding of how electrical synapses contribute to brain function."

This protein reshuffling is referred to as protein trafficking and cells must make the correct 'decisions' to control protein trafficking and ensure optimal cell growth and survival. The goal of this research is to understand how the cellular decisions that dictate protein trafficking are made. This multidisciplinary project pairs cell and molecular biology with powerful new computational biology approaches to define the parameters that determine how proteins are selectively relocalized in response to environmental changes. Key players in regulating these cellular decisions are a recently described, but poorly understood, family of proteins called the alpha-arrestins. Alpha-arrestins act as cellular 'mail carriers' ensuring that proteins are delivered to the right location at the right time. In spite of their important role in protein trafficking, there remain critical, yet unanswered questions about alpha-arrestin function including: 1) how do alpha-arrestins recognize the discreet subset of proteins they regulate? and 2) what factors control when and where alpha-arrestins interact with the proteins they traffic? In other words, how do these molecular mail carriers know which letters to pick up, when to pick them up and where to deliver them? Understanding the answers to these questions is essential; defects in the trafficking decision making process have catastrophic consequences for the cell. The interdisciplinary nature of this research project ensures that trainees at all levels - including high school, undergraduate and graduate students - gain exposure to a wide-array of scientific approaches. The research objectives of this project will be integrated into an undergraduate laboratory course to ensure that undergraduate researchers get to experience the thrill of scientific discovery while learning science fundamentals. Undergraduate and high school student summer internships will also be created to allow students to contribute to advancing the boundary of knowledge in the dynamic field of protein trafficking. <br/><br/>The goal of the research is to define principles that govern selective protein trafficking using alpha-arrestins, an exciting new class of trafficking adaptor, as a model. The alpha-arrestins, conserved from yeast to humans and related to the well-characterized and clinically important mammalian beta-arrestins, are a recently described class of trafficking adaptor that play a critical role in selective protein trafficking. While we have yet to appreciate the breadth of alpha-arrestin function, in yeast they interact with the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 to regulate the trafficking fate of cargo proteins. The alpha-arrestins are little studied and the experiments proposed here will define key posttranslational regulation of, and novel biological functions for, these critical regulators of protein trafficking. Specifically, this research will: 1) Define how disruption of the alpha-arrestin-Rsp5 interface impairs the ubiquitin ligase efficiency of Rsp5; 2) Determine how ubiquitination regulates alpha-arrestin-mediated trafficking and determine how Rsp5 activity is restricted to permit alpha-arrestin mono-ubiquitination; and 3) Comprehensively identify alpha-arrestin cargo proteins and define motifs that dictate alpha-arrestin-cargo interaction using a robust, new computational approach that employs evolutionary signatures to infer functional relationships. The results of this project will yield new paradigms for how trafficking adaptors are regulated, ubiquitin conjugation is restricted and selective cargo trafficking is achieved. Through the use of novel computational methods and complementary genetic and biochemical approaches, this research will establish the rules that govern trafficking adaptor function. Trafficking adaptors dictate cargo localization in all eukaryotes, thus the 'decision-making' rules identified from these experiments will provide vital information to researchers with diverse interests."

Living in a social group with other animals may require a bigger brain in order to deal with the cognitive challenge of maintaining social relationships. Alternatively, animals in social groups may have smaller brains because members of social groups can work together, thus reducing the cognitive challenge faced by each individual. This research will measure brain size in closely related species of social and solitary bees. Social cooperation has evolved many times in bees, and has also been lost many times: some solitary bees evolved from social ancestors.  This project will also measure levels of neurotransmitters and hormones in bee brains that are associated with aggression and reproduction. Scientists still do not have a clear understanding of how even relatively simple brain differences are associated with the evolution of complex behavioral traits. This research will use the small brains of bees and the multiple comparisons between many different social and solitary species to investigate how living in a cooperative social group affects the brain.  The scientists involved in the project will mentor students through internships in their labs, and will write versions of their research publications aimed at middle- and high-school aged students that will be made freely available on the web for education and outreach. <br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that the evolution of social cooperation leads to increased brain size. This research focuses on measuring changes in the volume of the mushroom body (an area of the insect brain), and biogenic amines of the brains of social and solitary bees. The researchers focus on the sweat bees (Halictidae) because this group is ancestrally solitary with three evolutionary origins of sociality and multiple evolutionary losses from within the social clades. Also, many species are socially polymorphic, exhibiting both social and solitary behavior. This allows for multiple phylogenetically independent social-solitary comparisons. The researchers focus on mushroom body volume because this area of the brain is used for learning, memory, and sensory integration. They measure biogenic brain amines because these chemicals are involved in regulating aggressive, social, and reproductive behavior, and thus likely involved in the evolution of social cooperation. Lastly, they test whether changes in levels of brain amines are mechanistically linked to changes in brain size, and also measure changes in amine receptor density associated with social behavior. This work uses a phylogenetic comparative approach, confocal microscopy measurements of brain volume, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements of amine titers, and antibody staining of amine-reactive neurons to test how evolutionary gains and losses of social cooperation affect the brain. This work addresses issues of broad public appeal - brain evolution and cooperation. As part of the broader impacts of this project, researchers will work with professional editors to create open-access adaptations of their studies for use in classrooms or other educational or outreach purposes. They will also train graduate and undergraduate students across five different institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to determine the neural mechanisms that enable a single stimulus (like an approaching basketball) to generate a rich repertoire of behavioral responses. To tackle this question, this project investigates visually-evoked avoidance behaviors in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster.  Drosophila, like humans, are capable of generating diverse behaviors to an object approaching on a direct collision course.  Drosophila also provide cutting edge genetic tools for precisely manipulating and recording activity from specific neurons during these behaviors. This project applies these tools to uncover the neural pathways involved in these behaviors and determine how their activity generates behavioral diversity. Upon completion of this project, these findings will apply broadly to understanding how behavioral diversity arises and how appropriate behavioral responses are selected. This research may guide future efforts to restore behavioral responses in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.  This work may also support the development of assistive therapies to aid patients who have difficulties in selecting or executing actions.  Finally, through educational outreach, experimental tools and outcomes will be disseminated through hands-on activities and active learning paradigms that target communities underrepresented in STEM careers and higher education.  <br/><br/>When faced with a looming stimulus, like a predator approaching on a direct collision course, Drosophila select amongst a range of behavioral possibilities, including running, freezing, and flight initiation.  Drosophila also exhibit flexible control over the duration and timing of these behaviors to optimize their chance of survival. Here, newly discovered, genetically and electrophysiologically accessible sensorimotor pathways in Drosophila melanogaster are probed to uncover how behavioral responses are selected and coordinated. Nine of these pathways project within regions of the brain that process the visual features of an approaching object and terminate on motor centers in the ventral nerve cord (fly spinal cord) that control the leg and wing movements of avoidance maneuvers. Preliminary data support the hypothesis that the selection and coordination of avoidance maneuvers results from differential activation timing across these pathways.  To evaluate this hypothesis, the research objectives will (1) link pathway activity to behavioral responses and (2) determine the mechanisms underlying differential activation timing.  Objectives will be delivered by employing a newly developed behavioral assay, computer vision algorithms for detailed kinematic tracking and behavioral analysis, whole-cell electrophysiology in behaving animals, and computational modeling.  As the ability to generate diverse collision avoidance behaviors is conserved from flies to humans, the neural substrates and mechanisms that drive looming evoked behaviors in Drosophila will provide models for how these behaviors emerge within larger nervous systems, and provide general principles for how actions may be selected through parallel sensorimotor pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These records will, in turn, contribute to active research initiatives in biology, horticulture and environmental management at Penn State and within the larger regional botanical community.  This project will fill critical gaps in knowledge of plant communities in urban environments of the Mid-Atlantic Region by providing key information on plant diversity in non-urban landscapes.  It also serves to train the next generation of botanists through experiential learning in state-of-the-art digitization and databasing techniques, make important components of the collection accessible to a broad array of researchers within the region and beyond, and engage both students and faculty as well as the local community in herbarium programs and activities.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to generate and distribute, through partnering with the ongoing Mid-Atlantic Megalopolis TCN, high-resolution digital images of the collection of vascular plant specimens at the PAC Herbarium.

The design concept and the digital instrument will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses. The students will be trained and prepared with the expertise needed for the next generation of engineers and researchers by being exposed to the underlying engineering/science principles and hands-on experiences.  The research activities will also provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduates and K-12 students.  Through multiple education and outreach programs such as ""High School Bridge"", ""Increasing Diversity in Engineering Academics"" and ""Women in Engineering"" programs at UA, and ""Multicultural Engineering Program"", ""Exploration U Programs"", and the ""Spectacular Science Event"" programs at PSU, we will recruit undergraduate and middle/high school students, with an emphasis on underrepresented and female students, to participate in the proposed research activities. The goal is to extend the learning environment beyond the classroom, motivate the student interests and improve the retention in STEM fields via interacting with experienced researchers.  The proposed education and outreach activities will help cultivate a high-tech environment in Ohio and Pennsylvania, two of the rust-belt states in the nation, and directly impact revitalization of high-tech industry through science education. This instrument is expected to advance cellular and molecular biology research, and become a useful tool for the scientific communities in Northeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania and the nation.  Other societal benefits include improving biodefense, protecting the environment and facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis.<br/><br/>The proposed instrument will advance the field of biomolecule detection for the following innovations and capabilities. First, with the unique design of micropillar cartridges through molecular recognition, measurement of biomolecules can be converted to digital signals. The digital counting does not need tedious calibration curves or involve signal decay. Thus, the measurement will be more robust and reliable. Secondly, one target biomolecule can in principle be represented by one digital spike, which holds great potential for digital detection of biomolecules of ultra-low abundance, at single-molecule resolution. This ultra-high resolution and digitization capability are difficult to achieve with current state-of-the-art methods. Thirdly, this instrument will be a promising universal platform for detecting a broad range of biomolecules. Fourthly, this instrument will enable rapid detection of multiple biomolecules simultaneously by using multiple cartridges. Fifthly, the sensors will have a long shelf life and allow for field applications since the sensors are tolerant of harsh environments. An instrument with these unique capabilities is currently unavailable. This sensitive instrument holds great promise for the analysis of various biomolecules from small-size samples. Thus, it can be utilized to advance many biological research areas including, but not limited to, cell signaling, stem cell biology, neuroscience, tissue engineering, and cell metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work will improve the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results will be presented to key federal agencies, so that they can be considered as part of the decision-making process for the COVID-19 outbreak. These methods will also be highly applicable to optimal vaccine allocation especially during the early stages of vaccine availability when supplies will be limited. In addition, it will provide a framework for future outbreak testing response. One postdoctoral researcher will be trained in the theory and methods of applied epidemiological research. <br/><br/>With a growing, but still limited number of imperfect tests available, the way in which tests are allocated critically determines what we can learn and in turn, what inferences can be made with respect to managing the disease for individuals and populations. This poses an optimal allocation problem for limited resources. The context-dependent nature of allocating a limited number of tests introduces additional potential sources of error and bias, making the question of optimal testing allocation a unique challenge. Current modeling efforts focus necessarily on disease dynamics and the efficacy of intervention strategies, but few consider testing, contact tracing, and isolation strategies explicitly. Unlike shelter-in-place or social distancing mandates, the impact of test allocation on management strategy decision-making is density-dependent. While testing remains limited, it is critical to explicitly model test allocation and strategies that involve both monitoring and management. The key to successful surveillance is to actively design surveillance strategies for a specific objective. The project will use a principle of effective monitoring based on two steps. First, identify the objective of the monitoring? Second, tailor the sampling design to achieve that objective, in this case selecting groups of individuals in a nonrepresentative way and to separately estimate the probabilities that a randomly sampled individual would appear in these groups. Misclassification of disease state (e.g., false positives/negatives) due to the specificity and sensitivity of different tests, the performance of different test platforms  and population-level incidence will also be addressed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems are crucial for the control and elimination of animal and human infectious diseases. For newly emerging diseases, as well as those that have not been well studied, the development of evidence-based policy is hampered by a lack of locally-specific data. This lack is also faced by many low-and-middle income countries. The project will use outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus in Turkey as a case-study. Working with well-documented surveillance on historical outbreaks, this project will identify what data are necessary to estimate disease burden and outbreak risk, and will evaluate FMD mitigation strategies. The researchers will then work with veterinary training workshops in Kenya and Uganda to translate lessons learned from the Turkey case-study to the development of surveillance programs in East Africa. The resulting theory and methods will serve as a guide for developing surveillance systems for a wide variety of animal and human diseases in the US and elsewhere.

While surveillance data will always advance scientific understanding, model-based prioritization of data collection and surveillance system design will lead to more efficient data collection to specifically support policy goals. This research will retrospectively analyze a time series of FMD virus outbreaks in livestock in Turkey between 2001-2012. This data set, which includes detailed records of the location, timing, size, and virus strain for each outbreak is uncommonly well-resolved and represents a gold standard of a nearly perfect surveillance system for a livestock disease. This project will first fit spatially-explicit stochastic models of farm-to-farm FMD transmission to the full data to derive the best-case understanding of dynamics, and predictability, of an FMD outbreak; this analysis will be the first country-scale model of endemic FMD transmission. Then, the researchers will strip away elements of the data to assess the minimally sufficient data necessary to estimate the burden of FMD disease, estimate the risk of FMD outbreaks, and evaluate FMD mitigation strategies, relative to the best-case analysis. The result will be novel methods for the integration of current model predictions into the optimal allocation of future surveillance to detect and/or mitigate outbreaks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the outstandingly rich, relatively little-known fossil beds of Patagonia, southern Argentina, provide an unrivaled opportunity to learn whether life responded differently to mass extinction, plate tectonics, and past climate change on the other side of the world. This project will intensively sample and analyze fossil plants and animals from Patagonia through about 20 million years, from just before the end-Cretaceous dinosaur extinction (66 million years ago), through the early recovery period and the Eocene warming interval. Through groundbreaking field discoveries and state-of-the-art lab techniques, this research aims to transform understanding of the origins of the Southern Hemispheres flora and environments, the role of Patagonia, and the legacy of surviving living fossils now located in vulnerable rainforest areas as far away as Southeast Asia. The work will generate the most complete terrestrial record and curated fossil-plant collection for the Southern Hemisphere through a critical interval of Earth history. It will produce a new, globally significant reference point for studying mass extinction, recovery, and response to climate change from a fossilized living laboratory, with direct importance for conservation and ecosystem management today. In addition to scholarly publications and meeting presentations, a large number of educational, training, and outreach activities are planned. These will include exhibits, educational resource development for public engagement with the fossil sites, and a trilingual childrens book. <br/> <br/>The project will use field paleontology and stratigraphy at a series of exceptional Patagonian fossil localities, dating from the latest Cretaceous to middle Eocene, to elevate understanding of Patagonia's uniquely informative fossil floras. Most of the fossil sites are located in the La Colonia, Lefipan, Salamanca, Penas Coloradas, and Huitrera formations of Chubut and neighboring provinces. The research will focus on five, broadly related questions targeting significant gaps in knowledge. (1) Was Patagonia a refuge from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction? (2) What are the composition, diversity, and biogeographic affinities of the earliest Paleocene floras and insect faunas? (3) Do the Eocene floras and faunas contain lineages that now survive in South America, Asia, and Africa, as well as Australasia? (4) Do the Eocene floras document the earliest phases of South American isolation by showing a loss of Gondwanan taxa and an increase in New World taxa through time? (5) How much geologic time does the prolific early Eocene site at Laguna del Hunco represent, and what processes formed these unique deposits that preserved one of the most diverse fossil biotas in the world?"

The translation initiation rate is the key measure of translational output, as this rate specifies how much protein can be made from each mRNA and hence how much of a particular protein will be available in a cell.  The aim of this project is to examine and optimize a novel approach for determining translation initiation rates at a genome-wide level.  This approach will allow transcriptome-wide translation initiation rates to be determined quickly and efficiently in a single experiment and for any type of cell.  Ultimately, this technique will allow researchers to address fundamental questions about the process of translation more broadly and deeply.  The staff exchanges between the theoretical and experimental laboratory groups will allow graduate students and post-doctoral scholars to learn complementary experimental and theoretical skills that will enhance their training as quantitative biologists and biophysicists.<br/><br/>Ribosome profiling is widely used to obtain high-resolution profiles of in vivo translation.  Typically, ribosome profiling experiments are carried out in parallel with RNA sequencing experiments on the same sample.  The resulting ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing data, however, are not quantitatively comparable due to substantial technical differences in library generation and the lack of an absolute standard permitting normalization between these two independent experiments.  This conventional approach also doubles the amount of sequencing required and introduces additional statistical uncertainty in comparing the generated DNA libraries.  In this EAGER proposal, the theoretical and experimental expertise of the investigators will be combined to create a new experimental protocol to quantitatively measure messenger RNA abundance and translation from a single experiment, and thereby quantify absolute transcriptome-wide in vivo translation initiation rates.  This new experimental protocol will be a variant of ribosome profiling by combining features of RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling into one experimental method.  This eliminates the technical differences encountered in comparing the independent experiments of ribosome profiling and RNA sequencing thus allowing direct quantification of transcriptome-wide translation initiation rates.  This technique will go beyond conventional qualitative measures of translation control, such as ""translation efficiency"", and measure quantitative rates of protein production in vivo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chromosomes must be positioned correctly to ensure correct chromosome distribution during cell division.  Failure to correctly position chromosomes in cell division leads to aneuploidy (extra or missing chromosomes) and can be catastrophic for the cell and, ultimately, the organism. Chromosomes must attach to the spindle, typically with one attachment site facing each spindle pole.  This bipolar attachment guarantees that partner chromosomes will separate from one another in anaphase.  In metaphase, after forming a bipolar attachment, chromosomes of nearly all organisms align in the center of the spindle forming the metaphase plate.   The alignment of chromosomes in the center of the spindle in metaphase may be simply a consequence of the ""tug of war"" that the chromosome is experiencing as a result of a bipolar attachment, with both sides of the chromosome under equal tension.  Alternatively, the positioning of chromosomes at the center of the spindle could be essential for guaranteeing correct distribution in anaphase.   The fact that chromosomes align at the center of the spindle in nearly all cell types (the behavior is nearly universal), and that mutants that fail to align chromosomes produce aneuploid cells, suggests that that metaphase alignment at the center of the spindle is important for directing appropriate chromosome separation and movement in anaphase.  The aim of this project is to learn more about how chromosomes align at the center of the spindle, and how the placement and the timing of this alignment can impact distribution of chromosomes during anaphase.  The Broader Impact activities will address the problem that there are very few tools available to biology instructors for teaching cell division.  A series of narrated videos of different types of cell division will be created for use in the classroom, thus beginning a collection of materials for future projects. These videos will be distributed nationally to any instructor who desire to use them in their courses. <br/><br/>In meiosis I, most chromosomes connect with one homologous or partially homologous partner to form a bivalent.  Bivalents align on the metaphase plate and then homologues initiate segregation at anaphase I onset.  However, in males from some taxa (e.g., praying mantids and the cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides), the X1, X2, and Y chromosomes form a trivalent during meiosis I.  The X1, X2, and Y chromosomes each have a single kinetochore, with X1 and X2 associating with one pole in metaphase I, while the Y chromosome associates with the other pole. Though the trivalent has two kinetochores facing one pole and one facing the other, it aligns with all autosomes on the metaphase I plate. In addition, metaphase I appears to be so important that anaphase I is delayed for the trivalent, with the autosomes separating approximately 20 minutes before the X1, X2, and Y chromosomes. This project aims to determine how forces are balanced to align the trivalent on the metaphase plate, and then how the chromosomes that make up the trivalent segregate correctly into daughter cells, using electron microscopy, laser microsurgery, immunofluorescence staining, and small molecule inhibitors."

Gregory (University of Pennsylvania)<br/><br/>Co-PIs:  Eric Lyons and Mark Beilstein (University of Arizona)<br/> <br/>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of molecules gaining attention for their roles in various biological processes. lncRNAs are defined by the fact that they do not code for proteins and are therefore not mRNAs. In addition, they do not fit into other well-defined small silencing RNA-producing categories such as small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite the importance of lncRNAs in development, epigenetic modification, and stress responses, there is still much to be learned about their structure, protein interactions, and functions, especially in model and crop plant species. This project will address this significant gap using a combination of genomic, evolutionary, and bioinformatics approaches. It is anticipated that the data, web-accessible genome analytical tools, and data management systems developed by the project will provide novel insights into plant gene expression regulation by lncRNAs, and provide important new findings and resources for studies focused on the improvement of numerous crop and genetic model plants. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide interdisciplinary research training in RNA biology, computational science and evolutionary biology for students and postdoctoral associates.  In addition, the project will develop an interdisciplinary course entitled ""Applied Concepts in RNA Biology"" that will leverage large-scale computing and datasets to understand various aspects of the role of RNA in biological systems.  This project-based course will teach the fundamentals of RNA biology, next-generation sequencing techniques, distributed and high performance computing, data-intensive science, and collaborative research techniques that will be used in student-driven research projects. The course will be taught simultaneously at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona, with two-way audio/video conferencing and lecture topics alternatively taught at each site. All project outcomes will be made readily accessible to the broader research community through a project website (https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/EPIC-CoGe_Tutorial), the iPlant Collaborative and long-term repositories such as GenBank and the Short Read Archive (SRA). <br/> <br/>This project is uniquely positioned to provide insights into the structure and function of lncRNAs, and their interaction with specific epigenomic regulatory modifications in the genome. The specific goals of the project are to define a subset of lncRNAs that are important for proper gene regulation in both normal development and stress response.  Specifically, the project will focus on identifying and functionally characterizing those lncRNAs that are (1) nuclear, (2) highly structured, (3) stress responsive, (4) protein bound, and (5) evolutionary conserved in genetic models (Eutrema salsugineum and Arabidopsis thaliana) and in crop species (Camelina sativa, Brassica rapa, Zea mays, and Sorghum bicolor), focusing on their roles in stress adaptation. Finally, the project will expand EPIC-CoGe, a central repository for plant epigenomics data across all species, with advanced data integration, visualization, and analysis tools to allow for the integration of functional genomics data to provide new insight into genome-wide epigenomic interactions."

This project funds enhancement strategies for developing the pre-eminent software package for shape analysis: geomorph. Geomorph promotes an appreciation of the necessary stages of shape analysis, and an understanding of the mathematical and statistical machinery required to evaluate hypotheses in high-dimensional data. The grant supports continued development of new analytical methods and graphical tools to be implemented in geomorph, which will expand the scope of research questions that scientists can address. New methods will transcend the focus of specific biological disciplines, and will broadly stimulate research in any field where shape analysis is important. Additionally, a new method of multivariate model comparison developed here has the potential to transform how we make scientific inquiry in the age of big data. <br/><br/>Geomorph is widely used by biologists with over 1,500 authors of 1,000 citations since its 2013 release. This grant will thus impact thousands of biologists who require fast, accurate, and flexible software to accomplish shape analyses for their research. In addition to research software and methods development, the grant will also help train the next generation of scientists through workshops and other activities. Workshops will be taught on several continents to provide maximal impact on the scientific community through these training and educational activities. These courses provide opportunities for scientists to learn and apply geomorph in their own research while seeking guidance directly from the software's developers. The project also supports open-source science by providing the scientific community with access to all software updates via its Github repository. The project will train undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in research. The PIs will continue to support undergraduate research for underrepresented minorities, through Iowa State's LSAMP and McNair programs (PI Adams), and through the Diversity and Inclusion Council of Chatham University (PI Collyer).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
