The ways in which major brain parts that are structurally distinctive have changed over evolutionary time are also poorly understood. These knowledge gaps are partly due to the fact that fossil brains are rare and have been difficult to study. This project features scientists from three collaborating laboratories who will pool their resources to identify a set of invertebrate brain centers that mediate learning and memory. Structural and functional similarities and differences among these areas will be established across modern insect and crustacean species. The major question this research is answering is whether these brain centers share common genetic and computational attributes due to the brain?s fundamental organization being inherited by the descendants from a common ancestor; or, because brains that have arisen independently in different invertebrate groups are not able to perform certain functions unless brain areas that give them these same abilities have also arisen independently. These questions will be answered by precisely measuring the brain structures in fossilized invertebrate animals and comparing their basic arrangements with modern counterparts. The broader impact of this research will be to identify invertebrate proxies of the learning-and-memory brain centers found in vertebrate animals alive today, including humans. Identification of such proxies will inform us about how brains have evolved, and will contribute to a broader understanding of how memory centers are organized. The results will impact theories of, and research on, neural networks and artificial intelligence, and at the same time the scientists carrying out this research will develop novel strategies for identifying genealogical correspondence of brain structures across a very broad range of species. Brains analyzed for this research will be digitally reconstructed in 3D and uploaded to an open-source database for education and research purposes. The research will also provide advanced neuroscience structural analysis and genomics training to students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The neuronal organization and circuit properties of insect mushroom bodies are well known, as are their functional properties for learning and memory. While the existence of mushroom-body-like centers exist across arthropods, it is not known whether these phenotypically or genotypically correspond to the centers in insects. The planned research will identify mushroom body-like centers across a broad range of species, analyze their discrete neural arrangements, circuit organization, and molecular attributes. These comparisons will identify the species within and outside Arthropoda that possess functional and morphological correspondences in these structures. Transcriptomics will address whether phenotypically-corresponding centers share common genomic attributes, and whether there are unique genetic networks that define arthropod mushroom bodies or whether these networks differentiate mushroom bodies in different groups of arthropods such as in insects and crustaceans. The identification of broad phenotypic and genotypic homology of these centers across a broad phyletic spectrum would suggest an ancient origin of these learning and memory centers. Equally intriguing would be results suggesting convergent evolution of learning and memory centers across taxa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exceptional navigation is not limited to animals with large brains, like birds and mammals. It can also be found in animals with simpler nervous systems. The tropical amblypygid, a scorpion-like animal, is able to find its way home at night over distances exceeding 10 meters through dense, tropical forest understory.  The study of how different types of sensory information (visual, chemical, tactile) are processed by amblypygids as they solve navigation problems can reveal fundamental design properties of simple nervous systems that are somehow capable of controlling complex, learned behavior. These design properties can inspire engineering solutions applicable to robotic and artificial intelligence systems. The study of charismatic tropical amblypygids also serves as an alluring gateway for teachers to introduce K-12 students to the importance of neuroscience for understanding how organisms acquire and process information from their environment and how this information influences learning, memory and associated behavior. To support engagement with K-12 students, their teachers and the general public, researchers will, among other activities, develop internet-based educational materials in both English and Spanish and develop various scientific inquiry activities for science events. <br/><br/>By conducting behavioral experiments that assess amblypygid (Phrynus pseudoparvulus) movements after they are displaced from a home refuge, researchers will assess the relative importance of visual, chemical and mechanical information in supporting navigation. These experiments will either involve manipulation of animal sense organs or the sensory cues in their environment. The neurobiological work will focus on a brain area known as the ""mushroom bodies"", which are thought to support spatial memory. In parallel with the behavioral work, researchers will explore the nervous system routes by which information from different sensory stimuli is sent to the mushroom bodies. Particular attention will be given to how the mushroom bodies ""engineer"" or ""integrate"" the different sensory inputs.  The integration of sensory inputs is hypothesized to be necessary to support complex navigation and will likely be crucial for the design of any sophisticated artificial system. Finally, the importance of the mushroom bodies in navigation, and their capacity to combine different sources of sensory information, will be tested under the same conditions of the behavioral experiments noted above, except using animals whose mushroom bodies are impaired."

This project is aimed at characterizing how we build our sense of self, by using multisite brain recordings and virtual reality technologies.  The results will impact national needs in the consumer, healthcare, military, and industrial settings by advancing the fundamental engineering and neuroscience knowledge necessary to create the next generation of brain-machine interfaces, which are envisioned to support the integration of artificial and natural sensory information.  Optimizing these systems depends critically on understanding how natural sensory signals interact within and among brain areas, a knowledge gap that directly addressed by this project.  The educational goals associated with the project are designed to advance discovery and understanding of engineering and neuroscience, while also promoting teaching, training, and learning beyond the regular bounds of these disciplines. These goals are achieved by: 1) Engaging high school students underrepresented in STEM fields through the development of hands-on instructional modules, 2) Promoting interdisciplinary undergraduate research opportunities via internships at Arizona State University, 3) Mentoring students in the broader implications of scientific research through exposure to organizations engaged in the ethical, societal, and policy implications of neuroscience research, and 4) Engaging the public in scientific discourse through public lectures and exhibits, and thereby promoting broad dissemination of the work to enhance scientific and technological understanding.<br/><br/>Estimating the state of the body through the integration of available sensory cues (multimodal state estimation) is a critical integrative function for most organisms.  Although much is known about state estimation for the upper limb at the behavioral level, the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood in cortical areas, particularly at the network level.  This is due to several factors: 1) the cortical areas believed to play a role in limb state estimation are heterogenous with regard to the relative strength of their sensory inputs and display both multisensory enhancement and suppression depending on context; 2) technical limitations mean functional interactions among these areas have been challenging to characterize; 3) the relation between sensitivity to visual and somatic cues and prevailing computational theories of multisensory integration have been incompletely explored; 4) multimodal areas are thought to contribute to both perceptual and action-based body representations but how these representations interact at the neural and behavioral levels is not well understood.  As a result, it is unclear how a coherent multimodal estimate of the state of the upper limb is constructed and maintained.  The proposed series of studies address these issues by quantifying changes in neural spiking, local field potentials, and neural coherence within and among fronto-parietal areas of the monkey implicated in state estimation using virtual reaching tasks that alter the reliability and semantic information of visual cues."

This control is engineered by motors that extract energy from a fuel source and convert it to mechanical energy. Similarly, motors are an indispensable part of biology, and cells employ motor proteins to perform the energy conversions that sustain life. These molecular motors must minimize energy loss, be robust enough to withstand constant cycling, and display a high efficiency of energy conversion. Data science approaches, hand-in-hand with experimental work, bring forth the opportunity to learn how such features are achieved in a family of molecular assemblies that function as biological motors. The working principles revealed by this work will guide the design of better man-made, bioinspired devices that harness energy for the world's future needs, can potentially be utilized to enhance crop yields,  or even tapped to understand the molecular origins of ageing. Advances in computer technology allow us to bring the excitement of research into how these powerful molecular machines work to high schools with limited computer resources by creating virtual laboratories that illustrate dynamic molecular machines in biological systems at no cost. Thus, leading edge concepts in biology can be taught and appreciated, and spur critical thinking, at otherwise underserved high schools. <br/><br/>Molecular motors exist as large oligomeric protein complexes. A goal of this project to determine whether the oligomeric state or copy-number of the motor proteins is responsible for their low overall light- or nutrient-to-ATP yield, underscoring a ""biological energy crisis"". Three different V-ATPase motors will be investigated to decipher the coupling between ATP hydrolysis, reconfigurable oligomerization and metabolic activity. Reengineering of these motors offers tangible biosynthetic alternatives (mutants or chimeras) to improve biological energy turnover. The primary method for studying the motor proteins include molecular dynamics and multi-physics simulations. These computations will be guided by ATPase models derived from experimental data by machine learning of two-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy images. The computational results will be restrained by X-ray crystallographic and single-molecule imaging experiments. As a technological product, new schemes for deriving large-scale molecular dynamics from cryo-EM and crystallographic data will be developed.

Core concepts from this project are integrated into a series of impactful learning experiences designed to engage and train students at multiple stages along the STEM education pipeline. The aim of this activity is to promote the students' interest in pursuing advanced studies in STEM areas. In a separate activity, the scientific content of this research is incorporated into online and in-person synthetic biology education module in an effort to enhance the teaching curriculum for systems and synthetic biology.

COVID-19, which emerged out of the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 is now spreading in multiple countries. It is particularly concerning that the case fatality rate appears to be higher for the novel coronavirus than for seasonal influenza, and especially so for older populations and those with prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Any plan for stopping the epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Different data collection and testing modalities and strategies available to help calibrate transmission models and predict the spread/severity of a disease, have variable costs, response times, and accuracies. In this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project, the team will examine the problem of establishing optimal practices for rapid testing for the novel coronavirus. The result will be the Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM), which will translate into science-based predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic's characteristics, including the duration and overall size, and help the global efforts to combat the disease. The RTEM will fill an important gap in data-driven decision making during the COVID-19 epidemic and, thus, will enable services with significant national economic and health impact. The educational impact of the project will be on mentoring of post-doctoral and PhD researchers and on curricula by incorporating research challenges and outcomes into existing undergraduate and graduate classes. <br/><br/>Computational models for the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and data- and model-driven computer simulations for disease spreading are increasingly critical in predicting geo-temporal evolution of epidemics as well as designing, activating, and adapting practices for controlling epidemics. In this project, the researchers tackle a Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM) problem: Given a partially known target disease model and a set of testing modalities (from surveys to surveillance testing at known disease hotspots), with varying  costs, accuracies, and observational delays, what is the best rapid testing strategy that would help recover the underlying disease model? Several scientific questions arise: What is the value of testing? Should only sick people be tested for virus detection? What level of resources should be devoted to the development of highly accurate tests (low false positives, low false negatives)? Is it better to use only one type of test aiming at the best cost/effectiveness trade off, or a non-homogeneous testing policy? Naturally these questions need to be investigated at the interface of epidemiology, computer science, machine learning, mathematical modeling and statistics. As part of the work, the team will develop a model of transmission dynamics and control, tailored to COVID-19 in a way that accommodates diagnostic testing with varying fidelities and delays underlying a rapid testing regimen. The investigators will further integrate the resulting RTEM-SEIR model with EpiDMS and DataStorm for executing continuous coupled simulations.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded through the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation program (Engineering).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will achieve the same for applications that use videos to track movement of animals, cells, or robots, by producing freely available software for efficient and automatic extraction of movement data and directly adding such data to a public database (the KNB Data Repository). The software will be easy to use and adapt to new types of videos, issues that have so far been roadblocks to widespread adoption of existing video tracking tools. The ability to share both movement data and videos will stimulate collaboration among researchers. Both functionalities will enable fundamentally new advances in such areas as animal group behavior, behavioral genetics, cell biology, and collective robotics, and other fields that record the movements of many individuals. The software, because of its ease of use and enabled access to research videos from the database, will also serve as a tool in teaching at the K-12 and college level. In addition, this project will serve to train several college and graduate students in both biology and computer science; such interdisciplinary training is essential for advances in biological research today.<br/><br/>This project will implement a unique combination of clear, current graphical user interface design to improve usability with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to improve movement tracking accuracy. In addition, the developed software will enable users to visualize results for validation and analysis, and include functionality for users to correct any remaining tracking errors. This will enable users to get scientific-quality data output without having to employ multiple software applications and without having to manually post-process data files. In the context of the project, several workshops will be held and a website developed to improve accessibility for students and researchers in biology. The project will also develop a direct link to the existing KNB scientific data repository, such that users can access the repository, compare their results, or complete meta-analyses easily.

A central problem in understanding the origin of the human brain concerns the role of social life and the demands it places on the brain to generate adaptive behavior.  As humans evolved complex societies, it is thought that the brain increased in volume to enable advanced cognition.  Social insects are outstanding models to examine brain evolution in light of social complexity.  This research project employs ants as an ideal model system to analyze the relationship between sociality and brain evolution because different species form colonies that vary in size and the degree of complexity.  This research will also help us understand how exceptionally small brains are able to process complex social information.  The project will analyze differences in the size and organization of worker brains, and their metabolic costs to determine if complex social life has increased the efficiency of energy use in the brain.  The project will train graduate and undergraduate who will become skilled in designing scientific studies and will acquire techniques that enable brains to be imaged.  Students will also learn data analysis, and scientific writing and publication. The researchers will develop a curriculum to enrich the education of K-12 students by introducing them to the study of behavior and neuroscience.  The researchers will recruit diverse participants from the Laboratory Schools of the University of Chicago to encourage minority students to become activity engaged in science. The project will broadly support science outreach in the Chicago STEM Pipeline, Arizona Assurance, Brain Awareness, and Boston Upward Bound programs to address the critical national need to improve science education and train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>To determine how social complexity has influenced brain evolution, the researchers will quantify neuronal metabolic requirements, neuropil investment and scaling, behavioral plasticity, and synaptic organization in brain regions considered key to cognitive function.  Pairs of species representative of major ant subfamilies that accentuate variability in social complexity will form the sample groups.  The researchers will: 1) quantify energetic requirements of functionally specialized neuropil using cytochrome oxidase staining to assess ATP use; 2) determine if brain development is experience-dependent; 3) quantify synaptic complexes associated with cognition; and 4) couple behavioral performance with neural and metabolic metrics.  The researchers will determine neuron number and size and variation in peripheral sensory structures, and examine brain compartment scaling patterns.  Controlling for phylogeny, analyses infer how independent evolutionary events associated with collective intelligence shaped brain evolution. All original images will be freely available upon publication, in the absence of copyright issues.  Organismal data (specimen and colony collection data, phenotypic data, etc.) will be maintained in individual labs, and will be made freely available upon request.

It has recently become well-established that concerted motions (dynamics) within proteins are directly correlated to their function, but an incomplete understanding of this relationship currently exists. To further elucidate the link between protein dynamics and function, recently developed computational methods will be used to first identify and subsequently classify networks of interactions in proteins that are directly responsible for defining the motions that underpin their functions. Information regarding these networks will be organized in a database that will be made freely available to researchers interested in both studying protein function or rationally engineering proteins that possess desired functions. The potential utility of this database will then be directly tested by using the information contained therein to improve protein engineering efforts. Enhanced proteins generated using this database will be experimentally characterized in an effort to both validate and subsequently improve the information contained therein. This will not only lead to a deeper understanding of the relationship between protein dynamics and protein function but will also find immediate use in myriad biotechnological applications including the development of new protein-based drugs, enhanced agricultural products or the production of new, functional biomaterials. An enhanced understanding of the relationship between protein dynamics and function can also readily be incorporated into educational materials using a popular online protein folding game, FoldIt, which will be used in outreach activities that seek to inspire interest in STEM fields at the high school educational level.<br/><br/>The primary goals of the proposed research are 1) to better elucidate the complex relationship between protein dynamics and function and 2) to develop new computational protein design algorithms that enable the rational design of functional proteins from scratch. Our current understanding of the relationship between protein sequences, their structures and functions has benefitted substantially from the aggregation and dissemination of this information in publicly accessible databases. Although a direct link between correlated motions in proteins and the functions they carry out is well-established, no database of protein dynamics currently exists, which we believe severely limits our ability rationally engineer functional proteins. We will address this challenge by generating the first large-scale database of the dynamic signatures of proteins of known function and then cluster these data both within and across enzyme functional classes. Our findings will be incorporated into the Rosetta protein design software to develop dynamics-based computational protein design methods that will subsequently be used to engineer new dynamic networks within proteins. This will serve as a direct test of our understanding of the relationship between protein structure, dynamics and function. Experimental characterization of our designed proteins will serve to improve our computational methods and will further enhance our understanding of the interplay between dynamics and protein function. The long-term goal of this study will be to use the lessons learned in this study to generate cutting edge computational protein design tools that could be used to study enzyme function, enhance the catalytic efficiencies of existing designed enzymes and enable the de novo design of artificial enzymes with desired activities.Results of this project will be reported at <br/>https://sms.asu.edu/jeremy_mills and http://ozkanlab.physics.asu.edu/research.html.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Immediate goals are to develop artificial cytoskeletons to allow control of cell shape and organization upon command, offering insights into basic cellular processes. This project also examines societal impacts to inform the team's researchers and to help prepare public presentations to increase broader impacts. This work should spark public discussion on the role of hybrid organisms in society and will examine public concerns of producing something 'unnatural.'

The prediction is that these will form dynamic assemblages inside of cells that can be controllable experimentally through inputs such as light or magnetic fields to change cell shape and move other organelles.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways.  Understanding how organisms cope with environmental change is a fundamental goal in biology, and one that is increasingly pressing in the arid Southwestern U.S., where severe drought over the past several decades has challenged organisms in unprecedented ways.  There are generally two ways that organisms can acclimate to a changing climate: Non-genetic changes and genetic changes. Genetic changes are passed down across generations, allowing offspring to be more successful in the future.  This research will use preserved seed collections, together with natural populations that have descended from these same ancestors, to create an 'evolutionary time machine'.  By resurrecting seeds of dormant plant ancestors, and growing them together with their offspring under common conditions, this research will expose evolution in action.  Determining whether adaptation can keep pace with a rapidly changing climate has major implications for predicting the future of biodiversity, and the fate of individual populations and species.  This work will advance a basic understanding of adaptation, and will also inform management decisions, promoting ecosystem health and preserving biodiversity.<br/><br/>In investigating adaptation we are often limited to the endpoints of past processes, however resurrection experiments allow us to leverage preserved propagules to quantify evolutionary change across time.  The fellow will resurrect dormant seeds of Plantago patagonica, a widespread annual plant, from herbarium collections, and will compare them to contemporary genotypes collected from the same locations in a series of common gardens.  By replicating resurrections across an environmental gradient in northern Arizona, this work will simulate future drying and warming, and will assess how patterns of local adaptation might constrain adaptive potential.  This framework facilitates an understanding of the role of gene by environment interactions, and provides a framework for predicting future responses to climate change.  This work expands past resurrection implementations by growing ancestors and descendants in natural field environments, across a gradient of abiotic conditions, and by combining experimental data on phenotypic responses with genetic data documenting the demographic implications of selection.  In addition to its contributions to basic science, this work will promote a better understanding of evolutionary biology in the local community through collaborations with a non-profit STEM center.  The fellow will also lead undergraduates and members of the community in collecting seeds for a seed bank repository associated with the Southwest Experimental Garden Array; this effort will foster an appreciation for local plant biodiversity, and will amass seed resources from across a remarkable environmental gradient in northern Arizona to be used for future local adaptation and resurrection experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This book and associated program argued that science pervades all aspects of contemporary human existence and that our nation?s future economy and security and the quality of individual lives depend on the public?s understanding of scientific developments.  The importance of science for all remains true today.  Since 1990, however, the science and science education communities have made significant discoveries about how students learn, how to engage a broader spectrum of students in science, what are effective pedagogical methods to teach science, and what scientifically literate citizens and future scientists should know and be able to do.  In 1990, many Americans were noted to have little understanding of science or how it affected their lives, and many students, especially from underrepresented groups, had limited access to or incentives to pursue science as a degree or career.  These major issues still hold true in 2018.  Thus, the revision of ?The Liberal Art of Science? is an important and timely endeavor, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs while addressing continuing problems.  The workshop will bring together scientists and science educators to outline and begin writing an updated ?Liberal Art of Science? and to plan for the widespread implementation of contemporary recommendations for teaching and learning science by improving existing science courses and not simply trying to add more courses to a student?s already crowded curriculum.  Workshop participants will have diverse research interests in science, science education, faculty professional development, and science literacy.  They will also represent major scientific and science education organizations and institutional associations actively engaged in professional development of their members.        <br/><br/>Participants at the workshop will have significant obligations before attending the meeting at the headquarters of the AAAS in Washington, D.C.  Each person will be asked either to draft an outline of a chapter in the new book or prepare a presentation for the workshop itself based on their interests and expertise.  In addition, each person will identify one or two exemplary individuals or programs that use active learning methods, increase scientific literacy of students, or focus on learning outcomes that prepare students for a world that is increasingly influenced by science and technology.  The workshop, which will extend over parts of three days, will be a series of presentations, discussions, and small working groups and will result in an outline of the entire new document and a plan to disseminate and implement new recommendations for change.         <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When cells are infected by viruses, the cellular machinery is used to produce viral building blocks (proteins) that assemble with the genome into mature viruses that can be thought of as little machines ready to infect other cells.  For microviruses, which have genomes made up of single-stranded DNA, the machines contain energy and instructions to form a tubular DNA delivery device to transport DNA from the virus to a host cells.  The tube only forms when the virus is on the surface of the cell to be infected, and it falls apart once the DNA has been delivered.  Deciphering the mechanisms underlying construction and function of this kind of biologically-based tubular delivery device will have applications to the fields of nanotechnology and protein engineering.  The project will also have an educational impact by reaching students enrolled in a laboratory course taught by the principal investigator.  Part of the proposed research will be conducted in a virology laboratory course in which students will conduct hypothesis-driven research. The educational paradigm for this course has already been proven successful, yielding two class-generated publications with undergraduates as co-authors.<br/><br/>The production of infectious viruses requires a complex array of macromolecular interactions.  The tail-less, icosahedral bacterial virus, phiX174, transiently produces a tube by oligomerization of a DNA pilot protein H, through which DNA is delivered from the viral capsid to the host cell.  After DNA delivery, the tube disassembles. This proposal seeks to address several important questions about viral assembly and infection. A combination of genetic and structural approaches will explore the structure-function relationships in the H protein to understand how the chemical make-up of this pilot protein enables it to transport DNA from virus to host, what factors contribute to making the tube the right length, and what other proteins interact with H to promote proper function. Other experiments will explore how the H protein interacts with internal scaffolding proteins within the viral capsid to promote assembly of the mature virus, and these studies will be extended by reconstituting the early viral assembly steps in vitro.   Because other viruses are likely to operate the same way as phiX174, the results of this research should provide generalized insights on the protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions important for assembly and infection by tail-less viruses."

This project addresses this need by transforming Symbiota, one of the most widely used software platforms for mobilizing specimens in US research collections. Symbiota is an online biodiversity data management software platform that integrates data and images from networks of data providers. It has helped mobilize over 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections and is one of the most successful platforms for creating large collaborative data communities for sharing and displaying biodiversity data. Symbiota is used by 74% of the projects funded by the NSF Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and is thus a key platform to help digitize the estimated 430 million specimens in US collections that have yet to be digitized. Symbiota's success is largely due to its low learning curve and powerful set of tools for documenting species occurrences and integrating them with images and detailed taxonomic descriptions. But its widespread use has yielded significant feedback on how it could be made more effective. To accomplish this and aid its future development, Symbiota needs a fundamental restructuring. This project will transform Symbiota into a new version, Symbiota2, to catalyze contributions, expand research use, enrich education-outreach activities, and increase sustainability. Symbiota2 will enhance our ability to address a broad spectrum of biodiversity-related research questions by facilitating data visualization, linking multiple data sources (e.g., publications), creating better tools for data quality assessment, and monitoring data usage.<br/><br/>The transformation of Symbiota into Symbiota2 will completely refactor its code structure to emphasize modularity and improve usability and accessibility. This transformation will achieve the following goals, derived through direct management of Symbiota data portals and concerted and dedicated interactions with the Symbiota user community: 1) Provide RESTful web services so that data can be easily incorporated into a scientific workflow, 2) Build a plugin architecture to ease the development of new features, 3) Create a database abstraction layer to include a wide variety of backend database management systems, 4) Increase data utility by supporting analytical and visualization tools, 5) Separate the Graphical User Interface (GUI) from other processing so that new GUIs can be used, and 6) Enhance the data collection by making it easier to add new kinds of data and work offline. With these goals met, Symbiota2 will be a powerful biodiversity data management system fulfilling the needs of developers, data providers, researchers, and education professionals, as well as being interoperable with other biodiversity initiatives.

Also, this research has key educational goals and outreach efforts that will bridge research, education and societal participation. Building on Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) teaching and training approaches, this project will generate continuous training and research activity tools centered on studying microorganisms.

Finally, the project will promote international collaboration and participation of the public in environmental studies involving microorganisms, including the research process and sharing of scientific results on tropical environments.<br/><br/>Amazon peatlands are key regional contributors of methane flux currently and in the past, however little is known about the activity of their methane-mediating microbes or how the geochemical characteristics of seasonal flooding events affect methane flux rates. The hypotheses to be tested in this study include: i) methane flux is a process where the strength and predictiveness of biological and environmental controls vary according to the spatial scale in study; and ii) trait based microbial modeling increases accuracy in CH4 flux predictions at variable spatial scales and variable Amazon flood periods. These hypotheses will be addressed by linking the microbial distribution and the determination of peatland soil geochemical niches before and after Amazon annual floods, by isolating and testing the functional capacities of CH4-mediating microbes at standard or simulated ""flood"" conditions, and by developing a trait-based model to integrate geochemical and microbe functional limits on CH4 flux at local (meter) or broader (kilometer) spatial scales.

Animal locomotion is particularly impressive in contrast to that of human-engineered machines. The stability, agility and energy economy of current robots, prostheses and exoskeletons remains poor compared to animals. This pronounced gap between animal performance and technology stems, in part, from fundamental gaps in the understanding of muscle physiology and mechanical function. Muscle is the only actively controlled tissue in animal musculoskeletal systems, and therefore plays a central role in enabling and controlling movement. Yet, developments over the past 20 years have led to growing recognition that important problems in muscle physiology and movement sciences remain unsolved and the theoretical foundation of the field remains incomplete. In particular, the ability to model and predict muscle function under dynamic and perturbed locomotor conditions remains poor. This project will combine innovative experimental techniques with modeling approaches to develop new muscle models that can explain and predict muscle movement under a broad range of conditions.  The findings have potential to transform numerous fields? enabling neuroscientists, biologists, clinicians and biomedical engineers to ask questions about human and animal behavior, control of motion, function of muscles and bones, and capacity of the nervous system and muscles to change. The research team will collaborate with colleagues in clinical and engineering fields to translate the findings into applications in human rehabilitation, treatment of disease and injury, and the design and control of assistive technology such as prosthetics and exoskeleton devices.<br/><br/>In the field of animal neuromechanics, a pronounced gap exists between ?top down? approaches ? those that focus on whole-animal behavior but lack insight into underlying mechanisms? vs ?bottom-up? approaches ? those that characterize mechanisms but lack insight into their contributions to animal behavior. The team will develop new tools to bridge this gap: 1) predictive muscle models that include intrinsic viscoelastic properties; and 2) experimental approaches that integrate across levels. This project?s novel ?muscle avatar? approach will help bridge this gap, and enable rigorous analysis of intrinsic muscle property and neural activation contributions to control of locomotion. Aim 1 tests the ability of the muscle avatar approach to replicate steady and perturbed in vivo work loop patterns in mouse and guinea fowl muscles. In Aim 2, in vivo muscle strain, activation, and force will be measured during steady and perturbed running in guinea fowl muscles, and the muscle avatar will be used to quantitatively assess how intrinsic muscle properties and neural drive each contribute to stabilizing responses. In Aim 3, alternative muscle models will be developed, and the ability of each model to predict in vivo muscle function in high strain and perturbed contraction conditions will be compared. Computationally tractable muscle models are essential for closed loop neuromechanical simulations of locomotion, which are increasingly used to understand how muscle function and sensorimotor control change in response to aging, injury and neuromuscular disorders. The findings could inform clinical rehabilitation strategies and the design of assistive devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, increasingly powerful X-ray sources led to great leaps in the ability to obtain information about structures of biomolecules, which is critically related to the molecules' biological function. The first X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) came online in 2009 at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, granting researchers the unprecedented ability to see the detailed atomic arrangements in, and movements of, biological molecules in their natural state (i.e. warm and wet). Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX), a novel extension of crystallography making use of the extreme flux and ultra-short duration of XFEL pulses, has produced new insights into fundamentally important processes such as photosynthesis, helping to understand how plants and bacteria convert sunlight into energy and create the oxygen we breathe, making life possible on earth, as well as improving human health by aiding pharmaceutical drug design, for example guiding improvements in pain killers and blood pressure regulators. However, XFEL experiments with biological targets typically require very large volumes of data and thus a correspondingly large volume of scarce, precious protein, to obtain high-resolution molecular structures. Furthermore, XFEL facilities typically host only one or two experiments simultaneously, and only two XFELs presently serve the global user community, while more will be coming online in 2017. The number of biological targets that can be studied and the rate of discoveries can be dramatically increased through the development of innovative, advanced algorithms that reduce the number of necessary measurements and extract more information from the samples by fully exploiting the information content that is unique to XFEL diffraction, and by extending XFEL use to uncrystallized targets. <br/><br/>This project has three main objectives: (a) explore algorithms for improving data accuracy in XFEL serial femtosecond crystallography through modeling and optimization (beyond the Monte Carlo approach for data merging), (b) explore and develop novel phasing methods which exploit the full spatial coherence of the XFEL for 2D and 3D nanocrystals, and (c) develop structure-determination methods that can be applied to samples that cannot be crystallized, through XFEL fast solution scattering (FSS). FSS can provide dynamic structural information from ""snapshot"" diffraction from particles that can be studied dynamically in solution, broadening the range of samples suitable for XFELs. Further development of this approach to include statistical intensity correlations that are unique to XFEL measurements can potentially displace the need for crystal growth altogether. These new algorithms, which will be freely available to the scientific community, will increase accessibility and applicability of the revolutionary capabilities of XFELs for biological imaging by significantly decreasing the amount of sample, data and experimental time (and therefore overall costs) necessary to obtain high-resolution structures. Thus the project will contribute directly to improved understanding of the fundamental biomolecular mechanisms by providing time-resolved images of molecular machines at work.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. When a pathogen infects a new host species, it can cause disease. The host species needs to adapt to this new threat through natural selection. The more disease-causing pathogens there are in the environment, the more adaptations it needs. Pathogen and disease abundance vary substantially between different ecosystems because of differences in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental conditions. However, the ecological rules and principles that govern pathogen abundance in specific environments are not well understood. These principles are critical to understanding how climate and human-wildlife contact impact human, agricultural, and wildlife diseases. To define the most important ecological principles of pathogen abundance, the fellow will integrate bat genomics and ecology to quantify adaptation to pathogens across ecosystems and species, using field sampling, genome sequencing, and computational methods development. This project can affect disease management and prediction of climate change impacts on pathogen spillover. Another major goal is to expand science participation of local underrepresented students by introducing them to science in their backyard, the Sonoran Desert.<br/><br/>Infectious disease results from host-pathogen interactions in an environment conducive to transmission. The resulting patterns of disease prevalence are driven by complex ecological interactions.

This relates ecology to disease prevalence at three levels: across species in different environments (aim 1); within species across populations in different environments (aim 2); and within populations across time (aim 3). To do so, the fellow will sequence Myotis bat genomes across multiple ecosystems, develop a deep-learning pipeline to quantify selective sweeps in virus- and bacteria-interacting proteins, and correlate ecological characteristics with signatures of selection using GIS methods.

In all organisms, gene expression is controlled, or regulated, by crosstalk between proteins called transcription factors and specific small regions in the DNA that bind the transcription factors (transcription factor binding sites.)  A key to understanding this crosstalk is learning the precise nature of the ""regulatory vocabulary"" of transcription factor binding sites which potentially varies among organisms.  This project will focus on deciphering the regulatory language in multiple species of the single-celled protozoan Paramecium, a well-established model system in cell biology. The overall project will advance the formal training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, while also establishing a set of molecular resources for the international research community. Specific efforts are being made to organize and integrate all genomic and gene-expression results into a web repository that will allow users to readily query data for dozens of Paramecium species to acquire information about status and evolutionary history of all known genes. The scientific and training results from this project will help promote the growth of the field of evolutionary cell biology, thereby broadening our understanding of the diversity of cellular functions across the Tree of Life.<br/><br/>Much of biological diversity owes its origin to gene duplication and modifications in gene regulatory patterns.  The Paramecium system is well-suited to studying the impacts of gene duplication because the evolution of this genus included two complete-genome duplications that led to the establishment of a clade of distantly related but nearly morphologically identical species. This situation is of broad interest because two rounds of genome duplication are also thought to have preceded the emergence and diversification of the major vertebrate lineages. With complete sequences now available for most Paramecium species, and the evolutionary history of each gene known, the next goal is to determine the cellular mechanisms responsible for differential gene expression and the evolutionary mechanisms associated with differential gene survival. Using a set of efficient methods for discovering transcription factor binding sites, this project will elucidate the evolutionary history of the gene-regulation vocabulary over the billion-year history of the genus Paramecium. Comparisons among lineages that did or did not undergo complete-genome duplications will help define the extent to which evolutionary dynamics are altered in the face of massive gene duplication. Paramecium shares some key features with animals, such as harboring a transcriptionally silent germline genome as well as an active somatic nucleus, all within the confines of a single, highly complex cell. Thus, results of these studies in the Paramecium, which is exceptionally easy to manipulate, may shed light on the evolution of regulatory diversity in other organisms that are not as experimentally tractable."

These interactions are mediated by small protein interaction domains (PIDs) that bring together binding partners in a tightly regulated manner. The sequence of these PIDs encodes all the features necessary for their function, including proper folding in a characteristic 3D structure and the ability to recognize their partner specifically yet dynamically. All these features are the result of evolution, and thus are encoded in the evolutionary history of the PIDs. In this project, the PIs will develop well integrated computational and experimental methods that will analyze existing sequences to extract all the co-evolved positions and to evaluate quantitatively their contribution to folding and function. They will use one of the most abundant functional domains that mediate regulatory protein complexes in various signaling networks involved in cells as a model PID. Their methods will enable identification of how coevolved contacts contribute to the folding of these domains. The PIs will then examine the binding interactions of these domains to understand how co-evolved positions contribute to binding. This project closely integrates computational and experimental approaches, offering unique learning opportunities to students involved. This project will provide teaching modules, campus visits, and research internships for high school students.<br/><br/>Protein interaction domains (PIDs) mediate interactions in signaling networks with unique functional characteristics such as (i) displaying tolerance to random mutations yet evolving for new functions, (ii) being involved in allosteric regulations, (iii) interacting with more than one partner yet showing specificity in their interaction. All these features are encoded in their evolutionary history. Recent advancements in sequencing and in evolutionary inference methods enable us to identify co-evolved positions and also conservation profiles. In this project, novel computational methods will be integrated with experimental mutagenesis analysis to evaluate quantitatively the contribution of co-evolved positions to folding and function. Two objectives will be pursued. First, a small set of co-evolved contacts that dictates the depth and smoothness of the folding landscape, ensuring a minimally frustrated folding landscape will be determined. This will elucidate folding principles of PIDs. Second, by integrating the residue dynamic coupling method with the co-evolutionary analysis, the mechanism of co-evolved contacts that govern binding recognition and allosteric regulations in PIDs will be determined. With this information, the project will elucidate the how and why a set of co-evolved positions are critical for fold and function, and provide the blueprints of PIDs. The WW domain will be used as a model PID. WW domains are independently folded, small PID modules that recapitulate all the unique characteristics of PIDs. Moreover, they are one of the most abundant functional modules in cell, mediating regulatory protein complexes in various signaling networks involved in physiological and disease states. The long term goal of this proposal is to devise means for predicting factors that dictate folding and binding recognition of PIDs, which underpin all cellular functions.

Since an early divergence from other land plants some 450 million years ago, mosses took a different path than vascular plants to solving the challenges to survival and reproduction posed by terrestrial environments. One important trait that is well developed in mosses is the capability of drying without dying, known as desiccation tolerance (DT). This critical trait allows many mosses to survive and reproduce even in drylands, and may be the key to their survival in the face of current, rapid climate change. Syntrichia is a large and diverse genus of mosses occurring worldwide and generally in dryland habitats. Despite their dominance in certain communities such as biological soil crusts, surprisingly little is known about the drivers of biodiversity in this clade. This interdisciplinary project integrates research from genomic, organismal, population, and community levels of organization in order to build a robust understanding of past and present dimensions of biodiversity in Syntrichia. The overall goals are to understand the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that have produced and maintained functional diversity at these different levels of organization, and promote training, teaching, and learning via: (1) formal education through field and laboratory research; (2) informal education involving a classroom module, short-film series featuring mosses and biocrusts transitioning from desiccation dormancy, a citizen science program ""Citizens of the Crust,"" and a series of free public workshops.<br/><br/>The research will examine tradeoffs between asexual and sexual reproduction, and between phenotypic plasticity and canalization into specialized genotypes, by examining the mechanisms underlying traits (including phenotypic plasticity) that drive diversification, reproduction, habitat selection, and physiological trait evolution in environments with varying degrees of water stress. Specific methods to be employed include: (1) sequencing the full genomes of S. caninervis and S. ruralis; (2) using next generation sequencing (NGS) to develop genotypic markers for population-level genetic variation studies, signature transcriptome tools for phenotypic analyses (related to ecophysiological and ecosystem investigations), and multiple single-copy genes for phylogenetic analysis; (3) transcriptomics experiments comparing different development stages and sexes of both species in response to desiccation stress and reproductive state; (3) ecophysiological experiments on multiple populations of S. caninervis and S. ruralis, and all 15 species of N. American Syntrichia, to assess phenotypic plasticity in the key trait of DT; (5) population genetic studies of S. caninervis and S. ruralis in different environments; (6) building a robust phylogeny for Syntrichia and using it to understand evolutionary trends and correlations among the traits under study, as well as to produce a refined classification; (7) examining the role of genetic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity in the resilience to climate change of biocrust communities that are dominated by Syntrichia (with co-occurring mosses, lichens, and cyanobacteria) in field and greenhouse experiments."

Animals produce a wide variety of sounds to mediate critical interactions, including advertisement to potential mates and competitors. But why and how do distinct species sound different and what factors contribute to such differences? The widespread importance of acoustic signals in mate recognition and speciation requires a deeper understanding of the causes and consequences of signal divergence. In this project, the physiological mechanisms underlying sound production across an ecologically diverse group of vocal rodents will be studied. The researchers will test the hypothesis that changes in sound production mechanisms are mediated by variation in social organization and spacing. These studies promise to provide important insights into the evolutionary interplay between the physiology of senders, receivers, and their socio-spatial ecologies. The proposal provides training opportunities for a postdoctoral scholar, research technician, and student participants who are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematical sciences. In addition, the work develops inquiry-based learning modules that equip middle school classrooms with animals, microphones, and sound analysis software to foster critical thinking skills. The research will be supplemented with outreach at regional events and virtual live streaming of experiments in an indoor animal-tracking arena to allow the public to engage in scientific discovery. Digital audio, video, and morphological specimens will be permanently archived for open access in public repositories.<br/><br/>A central challenge in the study of behavior is connecting functional and mechanistic explanations for the evolution of complex phenotypes. Advertisement vocalizations used in reproductive contexts are among the most diverse and elaborate displays in the animal kingdom, yet understanding of the physiological mechanisms driving acoustic divergence is lacking. The goal of the proposed research is to integrate functional and mechanistic perspectives in senders, receivers, and the environment to understand the evolution of acoustic signals in relation to variation in social organization. Rodents represent over 40% of mammalian diversity and exhibit extreme variation in social structure and space use, even among closely related species. Investigators will leverage the exceptional divergence in social organization and acoustic behavior found in one clade to dissect the sound production mechanisms underlying signal diversification. The work integrates approaches from the field, laboratory, and mesocosm, including high-resolution acoustic recordings and laryngeal morphometrics, auditory electrophysiology, sound propagation experiments, and animal tracking studies to evaluate the socio-spatial context of vocal production. The findings will provide a rich dataset to investigate the evolution of communication systems in relation to variation in social organization, with broad implications for other taxa across all signaling modalities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will use biological collections in innovative ways. For this project, the fellow will use pollen taken from insects in biological collections to assess how the pollination behavior of these insects has changed in response to habitat loss. Pollination is critical to both natural and agricultural ecosystems, but land use changes can cause both the loss of pollinator species and changes in pollinator behavior that affect the quality of pollination they provide to plants. Documenting changes in pollinator behavior is necessary to accurately predict changes in the future but is limited by the difficulty of inferring species interactions in the past. This research will help resolve this difficulty by being the first use of pollen carried by historically collected moths, and one of very few studies to use historical collections to reconstruct plant-pollinator interactions. To broaden the impact of the work, the fellow will mentor undergraduate students in research, conduct public outreach and classroom demonstrations related to the research.<br/><br/>As the study system, the fellow will investigate plant-pollinator network change over the past 75 years in the Caribbean, which has experienced significant but variable habitat loss over this time period. The fellow will focus on the pollens carried by hawkmoths (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae), which are prolific pollinators that accumulate less biased pollen loads than other pollinator groups and are well represented in collections. As a modern comparison, the fellow will also collect pollen loads from wild hawkmoths in Jamaica. The fellow will non-destructively remove the pollen from pinned hawkmoth specimens by locally rehydrating proboscises, then identifying the pollen loads via DNA meta-barcoding. This technique will allow for reliable, standardized identifications that do not rely on pollen reference libraries from historical plant communities. Using this pollen, the fellow will test the competing hypotheses that hawkmoths will either specialize on plants they match morphologically or opportunistically visit a wider range of flowers. In the face of habitat loss, higher specialization will reduce the overall resilience of plant-pollinator networks but will likely maintain rare and threatened plants. During this project, the fellow will learn cutting-edge molecular and network-analysis techniques. The project activities will also allow the fellow to engage in outreach and scientific mentoring opportunities both at their host institution and with local scientists in Jamaica during field collection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Major droughts and floods will occur more often and will be more intense. These changes are likely to have a large impact on grasslands and the ecosystem services they provide. Scientists have studied grassland ecosystems and the plant species that live in them for many years. Predicting the future of grasslands as the environment changes remains a challenge, however, because it is very difficult to understand causes of patterns using observations alone. Controlled experiments can uncover what causes changes in grasslands with enough confidence to predict their future as they begin to experience conditions never seen before. It is also difficult to predict long-term changes using only short-term experiments. This project will expand on decade-long field experiments in which rainfall amount and variability were manipulated to learn how grassland ecosystems are likely to change. Results from these experiments will yield new understanding that will provide guidance to managers of drylands in the Southwest United States, and around the world. This project will also train a new generation of scientists, many of whom are members of underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>This project is guided by two hypotheses about endogenous and exogenous phenomena that interact with each other to generate dryland responses to changes in amount and variability of precipitation. (1) Endogenous biogeochemical and demographic phenomena mediate abrupt or continuous changes in populations, communities and ecosystem processes. (2) Exogenous phenomena, such as El Nio events that occur with low frequency, interact with endogenous mechanisms to affect system resilience, leading to changes in population dynamics and ecosystem processes. This project will capture the impacts of infrequent exogenous phenomena and the cumulative effects of endogenous factors on populations of desert species, communities and ecosystems. The project will build upon two extant experiments located in a Desert Grassland in New Mexico: (a) manipulation of rainfall amount (80% reduced precipitation, ambient, 80% increased) crossed with changes in nitrogen availability, and (b) manipulation of rainfall variability (control, enhanced variability by 50% and 80%). Long-term manipulations of precipitation amount are accomplished using rainout shelters coupled with irrigation systems. Different levels of nitrogen availability are achieved via fertilization.  Manipulations of precipitation variability are conducted by flipping drought and irrigation treatments from year to year in the same plots. Response variables include above and belowground net primary production, species composition, net nitrogen mineralization and leaf nitrogen isotopic ratios. This research has the potential to transform understanding of long-term ecosystem responses to changes in patterns of precipitation, which is critical to assessment of how ecosystem services are likely to change over the coming decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The bacteria may manipulate their insect hosts? reproduction in ways that improves the health or number of female hosts carrying the bacterium. Relevant to this study, these bacterial ?symbionts? can sabotage host sperm such that fertilized eggs laid by females without the bacterium die early in life (?cytoplasmic incompatibility,? or ?CI?). Currently, two common, unrelated bacteria are known to cause CI in insects: Wolbachia, and Cardinium hertigii, the focus of this study. The main goal of this project is to discover the molecular mechanism by which Cardinium causes CI in insects. The benefits of this work are at least two-fold. Bacteria such as Cardinium target animal cell division, a fundamental process that can be understood better when examining how Cardinium interferes with it. Secondly, CI-causing bacteria may be used for pest or vector management. The CI agent Wolbachia reduces the susceptibility to viruses of insects that carry it, and is currently being introduced around the world to mosquito populations, with major implications for reduction of vector-borne disease and the global bioeconomy. The project will also provide engaging science education targeted for under-represented groups through outreach programs for elementary school (U Arizona Insect Discovery and Insect Festival), high school (production of a book ?Animal Manipulating Parasites at NC State, and Iowa State George Washington Carver Internship program) and undergraduate students (via research opportunities at all three institutions). <br/><br/>For Cardinium strains that infect Encarsia spp., parasitic wasps of whiteflies, genomic and transcriptomic studies have identified candidate genes that are likely to be important in CI and/or symbiosis. The central hypotheses are that (1) Cardinium effector proteins involved in modifying host DNA during spermatogenesis are associated with the testes, and other Cardinium effectors involved with rescue of modified sperm are present in the ovaries of infected wasps, (2) the role of these proteins can be inferred by identifying the host proteins they interact with and (3) that the B vitamin biotin has a critical role in CI and/or the symbiosis. The project presents a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses with a diverse array of approaches, in four objectives: (1) Compare Cardinium localization and CI candidate gene expression in male pupal Encarsia, the ?modification? stage, with patterns observed in adults.(2) Identify Cardinium and Encarsia proteins involved in CI with differential proteomics. (3) Use heterologous expression to identify interacting host proteins of CI candidate proteins. (4) Investigate the role of Cardinium synthesized biotin in modification of host proteins. This project will shed light on the sophisticated CI reproductive manipulation by Cardinium. Cardinium has received comparatively little attention, but produces a virtually identical CI phenotype to Wolbachia with what appears to be completely independent eukaryote-interacting genes, a plasmid and not a phage, and an unusual type 6 secretion system. What is learned about Cardinium candidate gene function, expression and host targets will illuminate CI and symbiosis in both systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These assemblies behave like liquid droplets and provide a dynamic environment for biomolecular reactions requiring specific protein concentrations.  Some of these proteins are also known to aggregate and cause neurodegenerative diseases.  This raises the key question how the functional liquid droplets transform into the pathological solid aggregates.   In this research, advanced computational methods will be used to view how the structures of these proteins differ in the liquid droplets and aggregates.  The knowledge learned from this project will be essential in designing novel strategies that can disrupt pathological aggregates but do not disrupt functional droplets.  The concepts of computational modeling will be introduced into both the undergraduate research and high school biophysics apprenticeship programs at Arizona State University (ASU), a university with a significant underrepresented student population in a location that is home to a large number of individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.  The PI will pay specific attention to promoting a variety of dissemination approaches through the ASU expert database to introduce the concepts of biophysics and to facilitate the dissemination of materials to a broad audience.<br/><br/>Intrinsically disordered proteins, proteins that lack a well-defined folded structure, have been shown to participate in both liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and aggregation.  The former is reversible, providing important intracellular functions, whereas the latter is often irreversible and disease-related.  There has been increasing interest in showing how droplet formation could induce aggregation, but little is known regarding the structure properties capable of distinguishing these two assembly states.  One major challenge is the lack of high-resolution modeling methods for integrating observations from multiple experimental techniques.  In this work, the PIs will develop a novel computational modeling framework to integrate multiple technologies.  Specifically, all-atom explicit-solvent simulations will be used to investigate the structure properties of disordered proteins in both dispersed and condensed phases and how these properties are influenced by their interaction partners.  Coarse-grained models will further be used to investigate both the formation of liquid droplets and aggregates.  The impact of droplet formation on its aggregation preference will be quantitatively assessed.  The project will leverage computational tools to establish fundamental physics principles that govern the structural (dis)similarities between LLPS and aggregation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All these may lead to the decline and extinction of local populations that live in these fragmented habitats. Organisms in general have finite amounts of resources (nutritional energy) to invest in growth, maintenance, dispersal and reproduction. Allocation of resources to any one of these functions reduces the amount available to the others. This study will test the hypothesis that a tradeoff in the amount of resources allocated to dispersal versus resources allocated to reproduction serves as the physiological mechanistic link by which organisms translate environmental variability experienced in fragmented habitats into population persistence within those habitats. This study will test this hypothesis using a fast-moving ground-dwelling beetle in the fragmented habitat of the Southern Judean Lowlands in Israel. Through the outreach program Insect Discovery, about 10,000 2nd grade students in Tucson, AZ will use insects to learn biological principles in specially designed workshops and classroom visits. In addition, 66 undergraduate preceptors and 12 graduate students will be trained in science outreach and how to convey an enthusiasm for science to the general public. <br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation is a dominant feature of landscapes particularly where intensive cultivation results in increased fragmentation of natural habitats. A novel, integrative conceptual framework is proposed in which spatial characteristics of the environment, imposed by fragmentation, lead to specific life-history traits that increase individual survival and decrease the likelihood of population extinction. As habitat fragmentation increases, organisms should invest more into dispersal and less into reproduction, resulting in a resource allocation tradeoff between reproduction and dispersal along a habitat fragmentation gradient. Emerging from this are three explicit and testable hypotheses that predict that the dispersal-reproduction tradeoff is the mechanistic link by which organisms translate environmental variation created by habitat fragmentation into variation in species abundances that lower local extinction probability and increase population persistence. These hypotheses will be tested in a well-studied fragmented landscape in the Southern Judea Lowlands of Israel, focusing on a fast-moving, ground-dwelling beetle. This study brings together techniques from landscape ecology and ecological physiology across multiple scales, from the individual, to patches, to populations, to whole landscapes. This project will support Insect Discovery, an outreach program that uses insects to teach biological principles to nearly 10,000 2nd grade students in Tucson, AZ, most of whom are economically disadvantaged, underserved minorities.

The research aims to enable broadly applicable methods of visualizing dynamic motions of proteins and other biomolecules in solution at physiological temperature. The education plan integrates undergraduate and PhD students into the specific research project, as well as the broader initiative to develop ultrafast x-ray science at ASU. Opportunities are tailored to undergraduate first-generation community college transfer students to engage in mentored independent research at ASU. A team of undergraduate and PhD students will work together toward complementary research goals and will travel to large-scale laboratory facilities, such as the Linac Coherent Light Source at SLAC National lab, to learn how diverse teams of scientists work together. Student career development will be supported through cross-training opportunities at collaborator institutes, participation in international conferences, assistance with individual development plans, and other forms of mentorship. A new freely available open-source software suite will be developed as a pedagogical tool to help a broader audience of students master x-ray data analysis methods and explore new imaging concepts. A complementary optical diffractive imaging laboratory apparatus will be developed to teach experimental techniques. These hardware and software tools will be integrated into undergraduate physics curriculum at ASU and will also provide a foundation for an interactive diffractive x-ray imaging display to be showcased at public outreach events at ASU. The educational plans are highly synergistic with the existing NSF BioXFEL Science and Technology Center and the Compact X-Ray Light Source facility at ASU?s Biodesign Institute.<br/><br/>The scientific research targets the general need for measurement techniques that can reveal detailed three- dimensional structures and functional dynamics of biomolecules such as proteins. It develops x-ray scattering methods to determine structures without the need to grow macroscopic protein crystals or to cryogenically freeze samples, both of which are requirements of existing techniques that can limit their effectiveness for dynamic molecules. X-ray free-electron lasers are used to produce snapshot scattering patterns by outrunning atomic motions with intense ultrashort x-ray pulses of just 10 femtoseconds (10-14 seconds). Unlike conventional x-ray solution scattering, the analysis of two-point intensity correlations amongst snapshot scattering patterns can directly yield three-dimensional structures, and in favorable cases allows for chemically selective  imaging  of  atomic  sub-structures  embedded  in  complex environments. Structural changes may be sequenced in time to form ?molecular movies? by delaying snapshots until shortly after reactions are triggered with light flashes, temperature jumps, or by other mechanisms. These methods are applicable to a broad variety of biomolecular systems which includes, among numerous examples, proteins that are involved in photosynthesis, vision, viral infection, and signaling processes that regulate nearly all vital processes in living cells and organisms. Model protein systems studied in the course of this research will elucidate ultrafast dynamics of light-activated protein motions. In addition to the publication of results in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific conferences, x-ray scattering data and analysis software will be made publicly available and will contribute to the general development of ultrafast x-ray imaging science. Similarly, innovative hardware technologies developed in the course of the research, such as micro-nozzle designs for the production of liquid nanodroplets, will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish these goals this project will gather and analyze long-term human and environmental data to synthesize relationships and trends, and develop two complementary models to identify pathways that can lead to a sustainable water-supply transition. This project will directly involve stakeholders in multiple stages of the research to both learn from their experiences and ensure that outputs meet their needs. This project also will provide education and training opportunities to help students develop the competencies needed to collaborate across fields, a skill that is essential to tackle current environmental challenges. <br/><br/>The proposed research utilizes a ""convergence"" approach to investigate how integrated urban water systems can be managed effectively as they face increasing pressures from climate change, population growth, and other environmental factors. This research will involve a longitudinal analysis of system stressors, an examination of hydrological detection and change, construction of a Bayesian model to forecast the probability of stressors exceeding thresholds for transition, and development of a dynamic model to identify promising design choices. This project will benefit urban water-supply systems in four ways by: 1) combining institutional analysis with dynamic modeling to gain new insights into the role of institutions in shaping system dynamics; 2) linking the detection and attribution of hydrological change to watershed and policy processes, which will result in new knowledge about the drivers and the impacts of hydrological change; 3) synthesizing quantitative and qualitative data, stakeholder knowledge, and inductive and deductive modeling approaches to enhance system performance; 4) identifying how specific infrastructure and institutional design choices affect system resilience and transition probability. Knowledge relating design to outcomes is key because, although cities cannot control the dynamics of hydrological or human systems, they can alter design choices. Examining urban water transitions can also offer general insights for other socio-environmental challenges where preemptive intervention will be beneficial.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
