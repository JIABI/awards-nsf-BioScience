While evolution often serves as an engine of invention, it also plays an important role in streamlining, ensuring that organism  do not waste resources maintaining or operating superfluous functions. Many animals and plants have evolved symbiotic relationships with microbes in order to gain access to functions that their own genomic inventories do not provide. Microbes participating in these associations experience a dramatic shift from an autonomous lifestyle to one in which their plant or animal host provides many of their needs. Symbiosis provides one of nature's most potent opportunities for evolutionary streamlining,  often  resulting  in  the  loss of over 90% of ancestral microbial gene functions.  This research focuses on understanding the process of evolutionary streamlining in bacterial symbionts of feather-feeding bird lice. These symbioses have evolved (separately) many times from near-identical partners that have colonized different birds but have the same symbiotic functionality. This is a rare and highly prized scenario for the study of an evolutionary process because the high level of repetition provides unique insight into the roles of random change and contingency. This research will also provide a framework for science integration between Chinese and US students and researchers, along with a summer ""SIM-biosis"" camp that will train 7-9th grade students to develop computer simulations that can decipher the modes and patterns of evolutionary processes. <br/> <br/>This  project focuses on  understanding  how intimate and interdependent symbiotic relationships originate, function, and co-evolve. While many insects (along with other animals and plants) have evolved symbiotic relationships with bacteria that facilitate the acquisition of important new traits, this project focuses on feather-feeding bird lice, which have repeatedly and independently evolved symbiotic relationships with bacteria to obtain essential B-vitamins that are lacking in their diet of feather keratin. The unusually uniform and simplified lifestyle of these lice presents a unique opportunity to study the evolutionary outcome of repeated acquisition of symbionts under similar conditions. This project explores  (i) the role of drift and contingency in shaping the processes of genome evolution and degeneration in symbiotic bacteria, and (ii) the nature and mechanistic basis of integrated  functionality. The  project  uses  novel comparative genomic approaches underpinned  by  machine  learning/artificial  intelligence  algorithms  to  detect repeating patterns in highly-replicated genomic datasets that effectively represent replays of symbiosis evolution in lice. This will yield highly detailed insight into the  molecular  evolutionary  processes  and  adaptations  that  characterize  symbiosis and, moreover, the mechanism  by which evolution facilitates genomic streamlining in  nature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elaborations on basic machine learning models (""ensembles"" of machine learning models) can provide improvements in accuracy compared to standard usage, for various biological questions. However, the design of these ensembles has been fairly ad hoc, and their use can be computationally intensive, which reduces their appeal in practice. This project will advance this technology by developing statistically rigorous techniques for building ensembles of machine learning models, with the goal of improving accuracy. The project will also develop methods that use these ensembles for new biological problems, including protein structure and function prediction. Broader impacts include software school, engagement with under-represented groups, and open-source software.<br/>  <br/>Profile Hidden Markov Models (i.e., profile HMMs) are probabilistic graphical models that are in wide use in bioinformatics.  Research over the last decade has shown that ensembles of profile HMMs (e-HMMs) can provide greater accuracy than a single profile HMM for many applications in bioinformatics, including phylogenetic placement, multiple sequence alignment, and taxonomic identification of metagenomic reads. This project will advance the use of e-HMMs by developing statistically rigorous techniques for building e-HMMs with the goal of improving accuracy and improving understanding of e-HMMs, and will also develop methods that use e-HMMs for protein structure and function prediction.

Some of these proteins undergo a change in their conformation or shape to carry out these functions. It is challenging to visualize the different shapes of these molecular machines using traditional experimental techniques, such as X-ray crystallography. Therefore, the molecular level understanding of these processes and its implications for protein function remains elusive. This lack of molecular information makes it difficult to develop engineering approaches to regulate protein function. Molecular Dynamics simulations provide a way to observe these movements at the atomic scale. However, significant amount of computer time is required to observe long timescale conformational change processes in proteins. The objectives of this project are (1) to develop efficient algorithms based on machine learning techniques to understand how proteins undergo conformational change and (2) to apply these algorithms to understand the role of protein dynamics in transport of molecules across the cell membrane via membrane transporters. The specific transporters investigated in this project play a critical role in determining crop productivity and neurological disorders in humans. In concert with these research objectives, the PI will develop outreach activities teaching high school girls about computational methods used to investigate protein function via Girl's Adventure in Mathematics, Engineering and Sciences summer camp at the University of Illinois. PI also plans to engage African-American boys at local Urbana-Champaign schools via a three-day after-school program to teach them about protein structure and function.<br/><br/>This project will develop computational methods that can efficiently explore the free energy landscapes associated with protein conformational changes. This work is guided by the hypothesis that leveraging ideas from reinforcement learning technique and using evolutionary coupled residue pair distances as order parameters for protein functional dynamics will allow efficient sampling of free energy landscapes. The development of the algorithm called ""Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Sampling"" (REAP) has been initiated. Preliminary results have shown promising application of these ideas to several proteins. The fully developed algorithm would be particularly useful for systems with limited structural information, as order parameters can be identified using evolutionary coupled residues based on sequence information alone. The specific goals of this project include: (1) further develop the REAP methodology to efficiently explore the free energy landscapes associated with protein function, (2) test the new methodology to understand molecular processes of high biological importance but with limited availability of structural information. In particular, molecular mechanisms of substrate transport and its regulation for the following transport processes will be investigated: (1) Nitrate transport process via root-associated transporters in plants with applications in increasing the crop yields. (2) Serotonin transport in brain via human Serotonin transporter for elucidating molecular origin of neurological disorders. (3) Sugar transport via SWEET family transporter in Rice with applications in enhancing plant growth. Despite differences in their function and structures, these systems share similarities in terms of their modes of regulation that could allow for a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms in membrane transporters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MSA calculation is a fundamental first step in many biological analyses. Because of its broad applicability and importance, many MSA methods have been developed and are in wide use today.  Unfortunately, many real world biological datasets have features (large size and fragmentary sequences, for example) that make accurate MSA calculation very difficult.  Because poorly estimated alignments result in errors in downstream biological analyses, new MSA techniques are needed that can produce accurate alignments on difficult datasets. This project will develop MSA methods with greatly improved accuracy, and that can analyze the large and heterogeneous sequence datasets being assembled in different biology projects nationally. The project also has a substantial outreach component to women's colleges and minority serving institutions, and summer software schools to train biologists in the use of the project software.<br/><br/>Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and phylogeny estimation are two very basic bioinformatics problems, which sit at the intersection of machine learning, statistical estimation, and evolutionary and structural biology. MSA has particular importance in constructing evolutionary trees, understanding the function and structure of proteins, detecting interactions between proteins, and even genome assembly. Large-scale MSA and phylogeny estimation also require high performance computing and parallel algorithms, in order to provide adequate scalability. The team will develop new machine learning techniques to greatly improve MSA methods, and hence also phylogeny estimation, since it depends on accurate multiple sequence alignments. The core of this project is algorithm development, utilizing a variety of machine learning techniques (including Hidden Markov Models), statistical estimation methods (especially Bayesian MCMC and maximum likelihood), and novel algorithmic strategies, all focused on improving scalability and accuracy.

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow who will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Habitat loss from urbanization is a threat to species biodiversity. Most studies compare rural and urban biodiversity, rather than looking at how the species present in one location change through time. Museum collections can provide valuable historical data on what species have been collected in an area for decades. The fellow will use the bee and ant specimens at the North Carolina State University Insect Museum to understand biodiversity change in Wake, Durham, and Chatham counties, North Carolina. These counties contain three metropolitan areas that have undergone extensive urban growth. Bees pollinate a large proportion of agricultural crops, and are critically important in maintaining native plant biodiversity. Ants engage in plant defense, seed dispersal, and help decomposition in the soil. These activities make both bees and ants important for ecosystem function. The research will use trait-based and landscape-scale analyses to assess how bee and ant biodiversity have changed over time, and to identify drivers of change. The project will also evaluate ways to increase public appreciation of museum natural history collections which tend to be inaccessible and undervalued. This information will also provide best practices for urban planning decisions that protect ecosystem services and create models for how educational materials can be evaluated and implemented.<br/><br/>This research has four objectives: (1) Determine how biodiversity of bees and ants have changed with urbanization intensity over the past 100 years, specifically with regards to whether there is a reduction in native species. Urban intensity will be evaluated using road density as a proxy. (2) Use a trait-based approach to determine how the urbanization process has affected which species persist, and (3) use machine learning and simulation models to predict how projected patterns of urbanization will affect future biodiversity patterns. Morphological traits (e.g., body size) will be measured from physical specimens, while other traits (e.g., nesting location) will be collected from literature and species descriptions. (4) Create immersive (e.g. virtual reality) and standard media experiences using the results from objectives 1-3 to illustrate how bee and ant biodiversity has changed over time, and assess the effectiveness of these experiences in increasing public opinion of and appreciation for, publicly funded museum collections. The fellow will receive training in urban ecology, social science, taxonomy, and methods including machine learning and geospatial analyses. The fellow will also be trained in science communication and directly engage with museum visitors through museum events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The magnetic field of the earth has horizontal and vertical components and while many animals are known to use either the horizontal (e.g. salmon), or the vertical component of the field (e.g. sea turtles), how they detect and translate this information is poorly understood. Determining how animals detect and process magnetic field information will solve one of the modern mysteries of sensory neuroscience. It will also improve our understanding of animal behavior by clarifying how living systems interact with natural and artificial magnetic fields. More specifically, this research will determine the subcellular location and nature of magnetic particles in the nematode C. elegans by identifying the molecules that allow worms to detect and orient to magnetic force fields. Further, it will elucidate how the nervous system processes magnetic information. The project will support the training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as ongoing outreach efforts to increase science literacy among at risk children. Specifically, high school students will be trained through an ongoing summer science ""boot camp"" program and by recruiting local high school students to volunteer in the lab. They will learn how to generate hypotheses, perform experiments to test them, analyze and communicate their findings. Several graduate and undergraduate students will be given the opportunity to participate directly in the project, thereby gaining a complete scientific research experience. Graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in two biotechnology laboratory courses will also benefit by learning modern molecular techniques in the context of ongoing scientific research. All participating students will learn basic scientific literacy with the goal of presenting abstracts at meetings and co-authoring scientific publications based upon their research. <br/><br/>The production of a behavior relies on the interaction between the sensory, integrating, and motor systems in an individual. While much is known about the transduction of most sensory modalities, how animals detect and orient to the earth's magnetic field remains one of the final frontiers of sensory neuroscience. Recently, the principal investigator identified neurons that process magnetic information, identifying candidate mechanisms for magnetic sensation, and, importantly, the first magnetosensitive neurons in any animal. This project will determine the cellular localization of magnetic particles in the tissues of C. elegans by purifying these particles in animals with fluorescently labelled candidate cells, or labelling them immunohistochemically. The size and composition of these particles will be determined using TEM and SEM-EDX analysis. Atomic force microscopy will be used to measure their magnetic moment and subcellular localization. To determine which proteins are responsible for assembling magnetic particles near the magnetosensory neurons, RNA interference will be used to silence iron-related gene expression. The magnetotactic response of these animals will then be evaluated, and the localization of magnetic particles evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Candidate proteins will be tagged using PCR-fusion. Previous mass spectrometry analysis of magnetic particles isolated from the tissues of C. elegans revealed them enriched for the mechanoreceptor PEZO-1 and several proteins involved in touch transduction in other animals. RNA interference will be used to silence candidate proteins involved in magnetic transduction and record the resulting changes in magnetic responses in the magnetosensory neurons using the calcium indicator GCaMP6. Sufficiency will be tested by means of cell-specific, ORF-mediated, rescue of candidate genes. Subcellular localization of these proteins will be accomplished through PCR-fusion to fluorescently tag them. To identify how C. elegans encodes magnetic fields, GCaMP6 will be expressed in sensory and downstream neurons. Neuronal responses will be recorded in animals exposed to magnetic fields of varying directions and amplitudes. Completion of this project will reveal how magnetic particles are assembled and contribute to the detection of magnetic fields by C. elegans. The resolution of the magnetic transduction machinery, and the neuronal basis of magnetic field coding will likely reveal conserved molecular and cellular strategies for harnessing the earth's magnetic field in the production of adaptive behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon is essential for the development and health of all organisms. The principal investigator uses yeast cells as a model to study the molecular mechanisms underlying gradient sensing, which are thought to be broadly applicable to cells in more complex organisms as well. During this project period, the principal investigator and his postdoctoral scientist will mentor select biology students from nearby Malcolm X College (MXC), one of the City Colleges of Chicago, in an effort to enhance their chances of graduating from a four-year institution with a BS in a STEM field. The proposed undergraduate research and mentoring program is designed to inspire, instruct, advise, and support underrepresented students who may be interested in a STEM career. The investigation will also provide students and the postdoctoral scientist with interdisciplinary training through interactions with collaborators who are experts in diverse areas. Because the project is at the interface of math and biology, researchers on each team will gain a better understanding of the methods used by those in the other discipline.<br/><br/>The best-known gradient-stimulated cellular outputs, chemotaxis (directed cell movement), and chemotropism (directed cell growth), are required for a wide range of biologic processes. Although they ultimately exhibit quite different behavior, chemotactic and chemotropic cells face similar challenges: the responding cell must sense small differences in chemical concentration across its surface, determine the direction of the gradient source, and polarize its cytoskeleton toward it. The mating response of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae is chemotropic: mating cells interpret complex pheromone gradients and polarize their growth in the direction of the closest partner. Like many chemotaxing cells, yeast use G protein-coupled receptors to detect mating pheromone secreted by potential partners and thereby direct their growth toward the nearest pheromone source. The goal of this project is to understand how the chemotropic growth site is established before polarization of the cytoskeleton, and how the cell responds to changes in gradient direction. Various models have been proposed to explain how yeast interpret shallow pheromone gradients in vivo, but none satisfactorily answers the fundamental and long-standing question: how do the cells switch from the default polarity site they use for cell division to establish a chemotropic site, despite a near zero signal-to-noise ratio? Based on discoveries made during a previous project, the principal investigator proposed a model that answers this question. The working hypothesis is that mating yeast initially ignore the pheromone gradient, as they first colocalize and concentrate signaling and trafficking proteins at the default site, building a ""gradient tracking machine"" (GTM). Once assembled, the GTM moves along the plasma membrane to the point of maximal pheromone concentration, where it marks the chemotropic site. The priorities of this investigation are to learn how the GTM is assembled, how it moves to the chemotropic site, and how it steers chemotropic growth in response to changes in gradient direction. These questions will be answered using imaging, genetic, optogenetic, biochemical, and computational approaches, leading to a deeper understanding of chemical gradient sensing. Because little is known about how gradient-aligned cell polarity is established during the chemotropic responses of other eukaryotes, general principles are likely to emerge that will broadly influence the study of chemotropic phenomena. Moreover, many of the questions posed in this investigation are pertinent to other transmembrane signaling systems, and the findings are expected to reveal generally relevant mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within genes, dedicated regions called enhancers, consist of a patchwork of short sequences that bind to regulators of gene activity, called transcription factors. It is this binding that determines when, where, and how strongly a gene will express its function. The organization of enhancers is dauntingly complex. Despite four decades of extensive study, many general properties of enhancers remain obscure. For example, it is still nearly impossible to predict enhancer function from the DNA sequence or to construct an artificial DNA enhancer that would turn the gene on in the right kind of a cell in response to a right kind of a signal. This project will specifically address this problem. It will study in detail the composition and organization of an enhancer of a gene in a model organism, roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Its ultimate goal is to engineer an artificial enhancer that could direct gene expression in specific cells in C. elegans. Not only would this serve as a powerful demonstration of the understanding of basic rules of enhancer organization and function, but also be an important step toward designing biological systems with specific performance characteristics. The work on this project will be also used to provide research experience for Chicago-area school teachers, including those that work in schools located at the communities that are underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to investigate in detail the organization and function of an enhancer of a C. elegans gene. General lack of fine-resolution data (at the level of individual binding sites) for any C. elegans gene, hampers the use of this powerful model organism for understanding enhancer structure/function and computational modeling approaches. The project will start with an experimental dissection of a short enhancer expressed in a small number of neurons. These empirical data will be evaluated against comparative sequence data of orthologous and co-regulated enhancers to infer particularly conserved features of sequence composition and structural organization. Finally, a series of artificial enhancer elements will be generated. They will test specific hypotheses by replacing native enhancer sequences with different synthetic ones that retain basic features inferred to be important from the prior experimental and computational analyses. The aim is to construct a family of enhancers that retain little of the original sequences and yet produce a largely correct expression pattern. This work will advance understanding of enhancer function/organization, inform comparative genomic analyses of regulatory regions, and contribute to design of synthetic genetic circuits in multicellular eukaryotes. In a continuing collaboration with the outreach office of the Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology at the University of Systems Biology at the University of Chicago, the project will interact with the area high school teachers, giving them an opportunity for summer research experience and helping to develop teaching modalities that cover modern genetics."

Understanding the design principles underlying the multi-scale organization of communities due to competition between members of the community is important, especially as competition is one of the major driving forces that influence how microbial communities organize themselves within a biofilm. An integrated understanding of bacterial competition and its roles in controlling spatial community structure will advance our basic knowledge about microbial ecology and facilitate new developments in the area of  synthetic microbial biology.

To achieve this goal, synthetic E. coli consortia will be used as model systems for quantitative exploration; in parallel, a biophysical modeling platform for systematic survey and analysis will be developed. This project will yield a systems-level understanding of bacterial competition and community organization, thus providing critical implications for understanding microbial ecology and engineering artificial communities.

Human trash includes plastic, fishing debris, and metal, which have negative effects on marine resources. For example, some trash can be ingested by organisms including birds and turtles, and plastic can break down into small particles that have unique toxic properties. The study of the origins, movement, and consumption of trash in the ocean has provided information about ocean currents and food webs. Research by this investigator has shown that trash in rivers can reach similar densities as in the oceans. However, the sources, movements, and influences on biological systems of human trash in rivers are unknown, and are needed to develop efficient prevention strategies and policies. Also, studying the ecology of trash in rivers may reveal previously unexplored controls on ecosystem structure and function. This study will be conducted in Chicago- and Baltimore-area rivers, and include students from high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. Trash removal will be used by student teachers to develop lessons for teaching the scientific method across grade levels.<br/><br/>This research will examine the ecosystem role of anthropogenic litter (AL) in 3 size classes by adapting fundamental tools used to measure communities of organisms and movement of organic matter. First, the role of large AL will be measured. Urban rivers typically have reduced channel complexity due to straightening and flood management. Large AL may act as an ?artificial reef,? providing habitat complexity and organic matter retention that is otherwise lacking, and thereby enhance biodiversity. Researchers will measure stream organism abundance at naturally occurring debris dams (i.e., wood) and at those generated by large AL. Next, this research will quantify interactions between AL and microbes. Bacteria, fungi, and algae carry out important biological activities in rivers, removing excess nutrients and providing food for insects and fish. Initial studies showed AL has unique microbial communities compared to natural surfaces. Experiments will test how microbes are affected by the structural and chemical properties of AL surfaces. Last, movement of intermediate-sized (e.g., shopping bags), and small AL (e.g., microplastic) will be examined. Initial research showed that AL in rivers is abundant and mobile, with some portion always moving downstream. Because AL attracts common toxic chemicals, its movement may be an overlooked pathway for delivery of toxins downstream and into food webs. This work will quantify inputs, outputs, and re-distribution of toxins on litter surfaces in urban streams."

However, the short- and long-term consequences of genome duplication in wild plants are not well understood. This research will investigate the natural rate of genome duplication in a wild moss species distributed in North America and Europe. Researchers will create experimental, genome-duplicated offspring in the laboratory to measure how their morphology and reproduction differs from that of their parents.

These interactions are governed by the evolutionary rules of symbiosis, where viruses are most often considered antagonistic to hosts. The research team will investigate a symbiosis between the model archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus and its chronic virus SSV9. They hypothesize that a killing trait conferred by the virus to infected host cells establishes a conditional mutualism that is dependent on CRISPR-cas immunity, resistance, and the prevalence of infection. They will test this hypothesis using comparative genomics to identify the genetic basis of key symbiosis traits, genetic tools to modify these traits in virus and host strains, quantitative competitive fitness assays for both virus and host, and experimental evolution in the Sulfolobus model system following the evolution and coevolution of host and virus over time. This conditional mutualism provides potent, unexpected outcomes of virus-host interactions that broaden the role of viruses in complex individual-level competitive interactions that are ubiquitous in the natural world."

This process is mediated by proteins know as Release Factors, which promote release of newly synthesized polypeptide product from the ribosome. Release must be tightly controlled to prevent the accumulation of truncated or extended polypeptides that can be non-functional or even toxic to the cell. The goals of the current project are to elucidate the molecular mechanism implemented by the Release Factors during the fundamental biological process of termination of protein synthesis. This project will have a broad impact on the advancement of our understanding of biology at the molecular level.  Ultimately,  the mechanistic details of the ribosomal machinery to be determined can reveal new avenues for the development of antibiotics that target the bacterial ribosome.  In addition, the project will train both undergraduate and graduate students in powerful techniques in structural biology and introduce high school students to research at the forefront of structural and molecular biology. <br/><br/>All Release Factors (RF) share a universally conserved tripeptide sequence motif Gly-Gly-Gln (GGQ) that is critical for eliciting hydrolytic activity at the active site of the ribosome, the peptidyl transferase center. Despite a number of previous biochemical and structural studies, the exact molecular mechanism of how Release Factors promote hydrolysis of peptidyl-tRNA at the peptidyl transfer center  remains elusive. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed project is to uncover this yet undefined catalytic mechanism of RF-mediated peptide release and answer the long-standing fundamental questions in the field:  how do release factors promote hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA in the ribosome and what is the contribution of the universally conserved GGQ tripeptide motif to this process? As part of this work, multiple crystal structures of pre-termination 70S-RF complexes will be determined. These structures require the preparation of 70S-RF complexes trapped in the pre-termination state with the use non-hydrolyzable amide-linked peptidyl-tRNAs that will be engineered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Different people and societies have different color experiences, and even the same person perceives color differently depending on the background. Our ability to perceive this variation is thanks to a sophisticated color perception system, especially relative to other mammals. Other animals, such as birds, have even more complex color perception, and are among some of the most brilliantly colored animals on the planet. What are the underlying causes of this diversity? How does an animal?s surroundings, such whether it lives in forests or out in the open shape the evolution and perception of colors? One reason for our lack of understanding may be that color signals are frequently presented to observers, such as rivals, mates or predators, using movements of various body parts. Recent developments in high-speed video technology and computer programing now make it possible to accurately describe these movements. This project will therefore study the association between animal displays, habitat, and color by comparing closely related species. The over-arching goal of this work is to understand the diversity of color in nature, and ultimately, the diversity of how color is perceived.<br/><br/>While long recognized that display movements are integral component of animal signals, it is only in the past few years that technology (e.g. high speed video cameras, essential because many species can perceive movements much more finely than humans) and analytical techniques (e.g. deep learning methods to trace trajectories of movements) have become sufficiently advanced that they can be used to study displays in a comparative context, thereby linking them to differences in color and ecology across species. The goal of this project is to quantify display behavior, environmental and ecological features, social context, color, and color patterns across the Old World leaf warblers (genus Phylloscopus), chosen because previous work has shown qualitative associations between light environment, color, and displays in the group. Closely related, sympatric, species will be compared across a gradient of habitat types to ask how plumage color (quantified through spectrophotometry) and threat display (quantified by playback experiments and high-speed video) are associated with habitat, including background color and granularity, and prevailing light environments. New methods of analysis derived from comparisons of morphological shape will be used to place display movements on continuous scales, thereby enabling them to be ranked across species.

Neurons communicate with each other through their long cellular extensions that are composed of proteins, produced in the cells from messenger RNAs. The subject of this research is a recently characterized factor, Mov10, that regulates protein production by unwinding messenger RNAs to facilitate their translation into proteins. Mov10 is necessary for early embryonic development across species and for normal neuron development that includes producing the branches that connect neurons. The goals of this work are to identify the RNAs that Mov10 unwinds, to understand how Mov10?s unwinding activity is regulated and to determine how Mov10 participates in the production of the branching that is critical for neuronal function. This project will involve the training of high school students, undergraduates and graduate students in both scientific methodology and in the scientific process, including hypothesis testing. In addition, this work will inform public talks by the PI for presentation to local and state professional groups about scientific discoveries and the importance of supporting basic research.<br/><br/>Bursts of protein translation are required for normal development and neuronal function but it is unknown how this process is regulated. The goal of this research is to explore the key role of RNA unwinding on RNA fate. RNA helicase Mov10 binds in proximity to MicroRNA Recognition Elements (MREs) in 3'UTRs.  It unwinds secondary structures in RNA to allow access of the primary effector protein of the miRNA pathway, Argonaute 2, to MREs. Mov10 was shown to bind mRNAs encoding neuronal projection and cytoskeletal proteins in developing brain, suggesting a role for Mov10 in regulating translation in dendrites. The hypothesis being tested is that Mov10 binds RNA G-quadruplexes (GQs), which are stable RNA secondary structures, to modulate Ago2 association to MREs in the 3?UTR. The Mov10-dependent Ago2 target mRNAs will be identified using a brain-specific  Mov10 conditional knockout mouse (cko) on which Ago2-enhanced CLIP (eCLIP) will be performed. RNAs whose steady-state expression is Mov10-dependent will be identified by RNA-seq followed by Gene Ontology to identify cytoskeletal RNAs in both WT and Mov10 cko brain. MREs in the target mRNAs will be identified by mutagenesis of the 3'UTRs expressed in a reporter construct.  Regulation of Mov10 activity will be examined by testing the hypothesis that phosphorylation of Mov10 controls its helicase activity. The model GQ, iSpinach, will be used to examine how Mov10 phospho-mimics that are either constitutively phosphorylated or constitutively unphosphorylated unwind GQs. It will also be studied how Mov10 regulates neuronal dendrite formation by expanding on the observation that heterozygous loss of Mov10 leads to reduced dendritic arbors in cultured neurons. The hypothesis being tested is that Mov10 regulates Ago2 association with neuron projection and cytoskeleton mRNAs.

The extraordinary synthetic capability of the protein biosynthesis system has driven extensive efforts to harness it for societal needs in areas as diverse as energy, materials, and medicine. For example, recombinant protein production has transformed the lives of millions of people through the synthesis of biopharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes. In nature, however, only limited sets of protein monomers are utilized, thereby resulting in limited sets of biopolymers (i.e., proteins). Expanding nature's repertoire of ribosomal monomers could yield new classes of enzymes, therapeutics, materials, and chemicals with diverse chemistry. In the short term, this will expand the genetic code in a unique and transformative way. In the long-term, knowledge gained will allow researchers to diversify, evolve and repurpose the ribosome and the entire protein synthesis system to generate non-natural polymers as new classes of sequence-defined, evolvable matter. This proposal will also promote interdisciplinary education, including the specific expansion of STEM education and career opportunities for underrepresented minorities and women. Students will be trained to integrate principles from genome engineering, systems biology, and synthetic biology. As a form of outreach, the investigators will create experiential learning modules that bring synthetic biology research to K-12 and undergraduate classrooms and connect students to the science being done at our institutions. This new outreach program will ensure that advances made in this project benefit a broader community and will contribute to motivating and training young scientists and engineers. <br/><br/>In this project, the investigators seek to repurpose the translation apparatus for making new proteins containing multiple mirror-image D-alpha-amino acids. By seamlessly melding the integration of bottom-up engineering design, genome engineering, and full-scale systems optimization, the project will create a new framework for studying and engineering translation and the genetic code. This framework will be instrumental in sustaining the much-anticipated transformation in expanding the range of genetically encoded chemistry in living systems, with the potential for significant breakthroughs. For example, understanding the structural and substrate flexibility of the protein synthesis machinery may provide insights into life's origin and also lead to general rules for engineering protein synthesis to meet societal needs. From an engineering perspective, the research could enable scalable mirror image polypeptide synthesis, opening the door to cheaper and more effective peptidomimetic enzymes, materials, and drugs, and expanding the scope of synthetic and chemical biology. In sum, it is expected that this project will provide new directions for academic and industrial enterprises related to engineering translation, while simultaneously training the next generation of scientists and engineers to be full participants in the work force."

While these two genes can be thought of as forming a poison and antidote system, their purpose is unclear. Are they beneficial for the fungus or are they detrimental?  It seems they have formed a selfish partnership whose killing and resistance properties allow the two genes to be transmitted to every one of the organism's offspring, even when only one parent of a mating pair possesses the genes.  The primary goal of this project is to determine how these genes, poison and antidote, achieve this remarkable feat.  Additionally, the two genes appear to have driven a major reorganization of the chromosome in which they reside.  Therefore, a secondary goal of the project is to investigate the hypothesis that selfish genes are major drivers of genome reorganization in eukaryotic organisms.  The primary goal will be pursued by a team of scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students at Illinois State University in Central Illinois, while the secondary goal will be pursued by the same team in collaboration with evolutionary biologists based in Sweden.  In addition, a GK-12 STEM teacher from Central Illinois will assist with the project. Not only will this provide valuable research experience to the teacher, the PI and the teacher will design inquiry-based learning activities for GK-12 classrooms that involve experimentation with N. crassa and other harmless microorganisms. <br/> <br/>The two genes under investigation in this study are rfk, the N. crassa spore killing gene, and rsk, the resistance gene. Although the boundaries of the rfk killing gene have not been precisely defined, the killing function has been tracked to a 1500 base pair fragment of DNA on the third chromosome of a strain called Sk 2.  The rsk resistance gene is found on the same chromosome.  Different rsk alleles exist in nature, and not all of them provide resistance to rfk.  Additionally, rsk possesses features typical of protein-coding genes.  For example, it possesses a clearly identifiable start codon, stop codon, and open reading frame. This is in stark contrast to the killer gene, which does not have obvious protein-coding features, and thus could produce either a toxic non-coding RNA or a toxic protein.  The first aim of this project is to differentiate between these two possibilities and gather evidence on the mechanism of spore killing.  First, six previously isolated rfk mutants will be sequenced to produce a catalog of mutations that disrupt killing; second, RNA sequencing will be employed to map transcripts from a functional rfk locus and to determine the global transcriptional changes associated with killing; third, the full-length rfk transcript will be cloned with Rapid Amplification of cDNA End (RACE) technology; fourth, site-directed mutagenesis will be used to determine if random insertion mutations are more disruptive of killing than random point mutations; fifth, a group of six point mutations, which are known to disrupt killing when all are found within the same rfk allele, will be repaired to determine which combination of the six is critical for loss of killing; and sixth, protein chimeras will be produced from resistant and non-resistant versions of RSK to determine which parts of the resistance protein are critical for function.  The second aim of this project is to perform the same set of experiments on a different strain called Sk-3. Together, the two aims of this proposal will define the borders of the killing gene, determine if the killer gene product is a toxic RNA or a protein, provide a catalog of mutations that disrupt spore killing, identify transcriptional changes associated with the spore killing mechanism, and identify critical regions of the protein required for resistance, all for Sk-2 and Sk-3, two models of selfish gene function and evolution."

It is no surprise, therefore, that the skull has fascinated researchers across the entirety of Biology over the past century. In more recent decades, understanding the developmental bases of craniofacial diversity has been a major goal of Evolutionary-developmental biology. However, a paucity of experimental systems among amniotes ? reptiles, birds, and mammals ? has made it difficult to create a synthetic understanding of how developmental patterning has changed during the remarkable diversification in skull form. In this research Dr. Sanger will dissect skull development in an emerging model lizard, Anolis sagrei. Sanger and his team will investigate the expression and function of three core signaling pathways known to be involved in skull development in other amniote species. Through this research they will discover whether the diversity in skull form is due to minor or major changes in craniofacial patterning. Capitalizing on the inherent interest in the vertebrate skull, Sanger will also team with a group of professional educators to develop ""Getting Ahead in Life: Investigations into the Vertebrate Skull"", cutting-edge, transdisciplinary learning modules targeted to upper level high school and undergraduate biology. Embedded within these modules will be interviews and real-world data from leaders in the field of craniofacial biology, especially people from groups underrepresented in STEM. Together, Sanger?s efforts will significantly advance the field of craniofacial development and help motivate the next generation of students to pursue education in STEM fields.<br/><br/>One of the most morphologically and developmentally complex anatomical systems is the vertebrate skull. Although there is coarse similarity in cranial embryology among these groups, there is growing, yet disparate, evidence to suggest that cranial patterning has evolved over both small and large evolutionary scales. To date, however, our understanding of facial development has primarily arisen from only a few experimentally accessible avian and mammalian species, making it difficult to make broad generalizations about the evolution of cranial development. Uncovering the function of key patterning genes in previously undescribed clades is a critical step towards polarizing the evolution of cranial patterning mechanisms and to help elucidate the ancestral character state of amniotes. In this research Sanger and his team will investigate the expression and function of three core signalizing pathways involved in craniofacial development: Hedgehog, Fibroblast growth Factor, and Bone morphogenetic protein. This team will use new tools to manipulate the expression of these pathways in embryos of Anolis sagrei, an emerging model system in Developmental Biology, but a historically important species in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. With this baseline information in hand, Sanger will turn towards evolutionary patterns of skull diversity on a smaller scale, among Anolis lizards. Anolis lizards vary extensively in their facial length. Multiple lineages have independently converged on short-faced and long-faced morphologies. Sanger and his team will also determine the developmental bases of these convergent phenotypes. Combined, this research will determine how the processes regulating craniofacial development evolve over different evolutionary time scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Iron is an essential nutrient that is actively acquired by bacteria from human hemoglobin during infections. A key step in microbial iron acquisition is the extraction of iron-laden heme from hemoglobin. Using biophysical and computational approaches the investigators will learn how the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus uses the IsdH surface receptor to extract heme from hemoglobin. This process is clinically important, as it enables methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to cause infections. The results of this work will provide a detailed view of the mechanism underlying extraction and it will have a broad impact as other bacterial pathogens also use a similar mechanism to acquire iron during infections.  The proposal will facilitate undergraduate and graduate student outreach programs of students from under-represented groups at the PhD level. The grant will be used to support outreach efforts to community college students and promote diversity, inclusion, and the elimination of barriers to participation in bioscience research careers.<br/><br/>In this project a team of investigators will apply computational and experimental methodologies to decipher the structural, dynamic and energetic basis through which the Staphylococcus aureus IsdH protein extracts heme from human hemoglobin (Hb). This process is highly conserved and used by many bacterial species to obtain the essential nutrient iron. Recent structural data and newly developed experimental tools make IsdH a powerful model system in which to explore the heme extraction mechanism. The overall goal of this research project is to elucidate how heme is transferred from Hb to IsdH, and to learn how this process is facilitated by inter-domain motions. In Aim #1, simulations and experiments will define the pathway of heme transfer, and uncover specific receptor contacts that facilitate transfer and distort Hb to trigger heme release. In Aim #2, the role of inter-domain motions will be determined by quantitatively assessing their effect on the local concentration of the receptor, and the kinetics and thermodynamics of transfer. Because IsdH is paradigmatic, the results of this project will provide broad insight into the extraction mechanisms used by a wide-range of bacteria."

This ability is encoded within the cellular DNA genome, which is converted into RNA and protein molecules through the basic processes of gene expression. Among the many functions these RNAs and proteins perform is regulating their own expression. In fact RNAs are now known to regulate almost all aspects of gene expression, and play central roles in controlling some of life's most basic processes. A key question in biotechnology and synthetic biology is then: How can RNA molecules be designed to control the expression of target genes inside cells to facilitate applications ranging from using cells as chemical factories all the way to using them as environmental sensors? As with many biomolecules, RNA function is intimately related to its structure. In this work, the investigator builds off of his development of a new small synthetic RNA mechanism called Small Transcription Activating RNAs, or STARs. STARs are hypothesized to allow the construction of unique gene expression control techniques since they represent a brand new function for sRNAs. This project seeks to use STARs as a test-bed for uncovering the principles for engineering RNA molecules to precisely control gene expression inside cells. This work will help realize the potential of RNA as a powerful substrate for cellular engineering. It will also shed new light on our scientific understanding of the fundamental sequence/structure/function relationship that underlies RNA's central role in natural biological systems. The projected studies and research training activities are thus expected to have a broad impact on society, ranging from the science of cellular gene regulation and the engineering science of RNA gene regulation that can directly connect to a broad array of biotechnological applications. This project will also cultivate the next generation of highly trained graduate students and teachers of synthetic biology who will be introduced to the broad, interdisciplinary nature of biotechnology research. Moreover, this program will actively engage the broader community to help create an informed public that is equipped to make important decisions about the future of synthetic biology.<br/><br/>Technical Description:  The overall goal of this project is to build an integrated research and education program focused on uncovering quantitative design principles that link small RNA sequence, structure, and function, and to use these principles to design synthetic RNAs that can precisely regulate gene expression. The education plan focuses on integrating research into the training of the next generation of synthetic biology students and teachers, and informing and exciting the broader public about synthetic biology.<br/><br/>Trans-acting bacterial small RNAs (sRNA) exert regulation via direct RNA-RNA interactions with target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that cause structural changes in the target. These changes in turn regulate many aspects of gene expression including transcription, translation and mRNA degradation. The central hypotheses of this project are that: 1) quantitative sRNA structure/function design principles can be discovered and used to rationally optimize and expand the functionality of RNA regulators, and 2) circuit-level design rules can be discovered and used to engineer new synthetic RNA genetic modules that control the timing and pattern of gene expression. The central goal of this CAREER project is to use Small Transcription Activating RNAs (STARs) as a test-bed for uncovering the quantitative design principles of RNA regulators for synthetic biology. This will be pursued using a multi-faceted approach that includes using cutting-edge RNA structure measurement technologies to elucidate the molecular level design principles of STARs. Once molecular-level principles are learned, the project will focus on using these techniques to learn the design rules for integrating STARs into decision making regulatory networks. In addition, new experiments and computational tools that can quantitatively model the kinetics of gene expression mediated by STARs will be used to understand how different aspects of STAR function propagate through RNA networks. Successful completion of these studies will forward the broader goal of creating a quantitative discipline of biological design that can be used to program cellular systems to solve important problems in sustainable energy, and biomanufacturing.  In addition, the work may provide insight to mechanisms of native small RNA regulation of naturally occurring biological systems.<br/><br/>Educational activities include developing a long term plan for the continuation of the Cold Spring Harbor Synthetic Biology summer course as a training center for a broad range of students and teachers across the globe; developing quantitative curricular materials for training future generations of synthetic biologists; and performing hands-on activities aimed towards families with school-age children to excite and inform them about synthetic biology."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The focus of this study is a colorful tortoise beetle found in tropical rainforests, called Chelymorpha alternans. This beetle varies in color across its range and incorporates toxins produced by host plants into the outer exoskeleton as a defense mechanism against predators. By incorporating toxic compounds, these organisms become distasteful to predators, and by using bright and contrasting coloration they advertise that they are toxic, making it easier for predators to learn and remember to avoid them. Often variation in color or pattern signals individuals who differ in their level of toxicity. This research seeks to understand how individual differences in the ability to incorporate toxins from the plants contributes to survival in beetle larvae and predation as adults. Understanding how some individuals are better equipped to process toxins will provide insights into the ways that insects adapt to their environment and to agricultural pesticides. To broaden participation, motivated high school and undergraduate students in the Memphis area will be mentored in research and outreach partnerships between the University and the community will be facilitated.<br/><br/>In order to understand how intraspecific variation mediates the sequestration ability of plant secondary metabolites by larvae of the polymorphic tortoise beetle, C. alternans, an integrative study assessing differences in gene expression, larval and adult fitness and functional genomics will be performed.

To investigate the genotypic and phenotypic impacts on larval survival, individuals of different genotypes will be assessed for larval survival.  Predator bioassays with the ant predator, Azteca chartifex, will be conducted to assess genotypic and phenotypic impacts on adult palatability. Individuals that are better at processing secondary metabolites from the plant are expected to have higher survival through larval development, and those that are better at incorporating these metabolites are expected to have increased toxicity and experience less predation as adults. A cuticular hydrocarbon study will be used to analyze chemical variation between genotypes and phenotypes. Additionally, to assess variation in larval sequestration ability, the expression patterns of genes related to sequestration metabolic pathways will be determined. Combining chemical ecology, genomics and behavior will facilitate deeper insights in cascading effects on larval survival, adult chemical profiles and overall levels of palatability.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The goal of their project is to determine the ecological and environmental contexts which lead to the evolution and persistence of mutualisms. Mutualisms, interactions in which each species benefits (e.g., pollination), are quite prevalent throughout the natural world especially among plant species and play a significant role in many ecological systems. One key mutualism is that between mycorrhizal fungi and plants. In this mutualism, individual plants trade sugars and other carbon compounds for nitrogen, phosphorous, and other minerals from the fungus. The availability of resources (environment) and competition from other individuals (ecology) should influence whether or not a plant is better off trading their resources and engaging in the mutualism. The fellow will experimentally and mathematically explore how environmental and ecological conditions determine the evolution of the plant-fungal mutualism. This work will not only explain the evolution of mutualism but also give greater predictive power as to how ecosystems will change with increased nitrogen deposition.<br/><br/>The Fellow will run a greenhouse experiment in which two varieties of peas, one that can and one that cannot form mutualisms, are grown with each other along gradients of nitrogen concentration and competitor density. In conjunction, they will develop and analyze an evolutionary game theoretic model of plant-fungal mutualism. Evolutionary game theory can aid in explaining this mutualism?s evolution as it frames the trade between plant and fungus as a strategy to obtain resources and the evolution as the exclusion of non-mutualist strategies. This work will empirically test the predictions of evolutionary game theory, thereby integrating theory and experiment. The fellow will learn techniques to run a greenhouse experiment, develop their statistical repertoire, and hone their mathematical skills. Beyond scientific work, the fellow will also work to increase participation of groups underrepresented in ecology, particularly those with disabilities. Firstly, they will directly mentor graduate and undergraduate students with disabilities by including them in the research. Secondly, they will develop digital and interactive media on game theory and ecological processes. Lastly, they will host graduate workshops on evolutionary game theory and mathematical modelling and undergraduate activities where students dissect a topic in ecology and evolution, analyze it mathematically, and create a game from it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The molecular nature of enhancers is not well understood, although current evidence suggests they differ from other DNA elements by having a distinct structure within the chromosomes. Structural differences can arise from enzymatic modification of the histone proteins responsible for packaging the DNA in the nucleus.  This project focuses on studying the enzymes that modify enhancer elements and how their action helps turn on critical genes at the right time and location during development. The work will be carried out using a multi-disciplinary approach that combines genetic, biochemical and high-throughput bioinformatics tools in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as the model organism.  Because the mechanisms governing how, when and where genes are turned on and off during development are conserved across evolution, the results should have far-reaching impact, from yeast to humans.  The project will have broad educational impact by providing students with training in multiple areas, including protein structure modeling, biochemistry, bioinformatics, genetics and advanced microscopy imaging.  Students also learn how to develop scientific hypotheses, independently carry out experiments and interpret results, prepare oral and written summaries and publish their work, skills that provide a strong technical knowledge base for diverse scientific careers.<br/><br/>The metazoan COMPASS related coactivator complexes catalyze the methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 4 (H3K4), epigenetic marks associated with controlling eukaryotic gene transcription. The Cmi/Trr COMPASS-like complex in Drosophila is responsible for monomethylating H3K4 and regulates enhancer activity in cooperation with transcription factors important for normal development. Trr provides histone methyltransferase activity, while Cmi contains plant homeodomain Zn fingers in two conserved clusters that co-evolved over 1.5 billion years with chromosome compaction in nucleosomes. Despite the conservation and importance in transcription control, it is not well understood how the COMPASS-like complexes are able to prime and maintain enhancer activities during development. This project focuses on the role of the conserved PHD finger domains in chromatin recognition and key cellular signaling pathways that depend on precise enhancer control. Taking advantage of the versatile Drosophila genetic model system, this project tests broad hypotheses (1) that the clustered PHD domains found in Cmi and homologous vertebrate proteins contribute essential epigenetic histone reader functions that drive the proper priming and regulation of gene enhancers and (2) the Drosophila COMPASS-like coactivator complex regulates the timing of enhancer utilization to integrate key developmental signals. One aim of this project explores the combined functions of the finger domains in the conserved PHD cluster that are essential for proper enhancer regulation. Structural modeling studies of the PHD finger domains and targeted mutagenesis, combined with in vitro and in vivo measurements of chromatin association, will define the histone recognition and binding properties of Cmi and mammalian PHD finger domains and further elucidate the mechanisms of enhancer control by the COMPASS-like complexes. A second aim incorporating developmental, genetic and molecular analyses (ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, chromatin capture) will expand our understanding of target gene regulation in vivo, help correlate specific enhancer epigenetic marks with COMPASS-like complex functions, and provide significant new insights regarding conserved mechanisms of chromatin regulation."

Different types of these cells are located in a part of the brain called the striatum, where they are intermixed together. New molecular genetic tools will be used to isolate and characterize the sets of proteins (proteome) of these different striatal neuron types across development, and to track changes in the proteomes of these neurons in response to changes in the incoming information that they receive. Based on this work, new, genetically-modified mouse lines will be generated that will allow members of the wider scientific community to pursue proteomic studies with other cell types in both the brain and the body. A major educational goal involves the development of an enrichment course on imaging neuronal proteins for freshman in a Chicago public high school. Imaging offers young science students an intuitive way to learn about cell biology and cell function. This project will yield deep insights into the development of the striatum, and the ways in which brain circuit activity changes brain circuit function. The tools and analysis systems established by this project will be of broad use in diverse areas of developmental and cellular biology.<br/><br/>There are few existing techniques for genetically-targeted proteomic studies within native neural circuits that preserve the cellular context of the neurons being studied. This proposal introduces a powerful suite of techniques for unlocking the proteome of any cell type in the brain or in the body. The approach leverages the power of peroxidases, enzymes that can be induced to biotinylate neighboring proteins. This approach is based on the development and application of a new set of flexible recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) that conditionally express a modified peroxidase throughout the cytosol or targeted to neuronal cell sub-compartments. These techniques will be used to address a critical question in neurobiology concerning the development and use-dependent neuromodulation of cell types in the striatum. In addition, new conditional proteomic reporter mouse lines will be created and made available to the scientific community that will have a lasting impact by enabling a new generation of proteomic studies of neurons, glia, and non-neuronal cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop supported by this award is predicated on the 25th anniversary of the Freshwater Imperative, a research agenda developed by scientists concerned about sustainable management of freshwater environments. The original Freshwater Imperative was a collaborative effort to develop to a predictive understanding of freshwater ecosystems that would translate to improved management and mitigation practices in changing environments.  During this workshop held on the 25th anniversary of the Freshwater Imperative, participants will reflect on what freshwater scientists have accomplished over the past decades, what research opportunities have been missed, and what lessons have been learned about responding to environmental crises. Through multiple activities, workshop participants will identify grand challenges in freshwater science and craft a forward-looking research agenda. The workshop will aim to identify the key challenges for freshwater ecosystem research and management, to synthesize existing understanding in an effort to fill critical knowledge gaps, and to consider how cutting-edge analytical approaches and emerging methods can inform both short- and long-term research agendas.  Specifically, the workshop participants will be asked: Have predictions of the Freshwater Imperative been realized? What current threats and challenges were not predicted? What are the components of a new research agenda?  These questions are motivated by the continued, and in many cases, accelerating degradation of freshwater resources, combined with an explosion of innovative research tools and approaches developed over the past 25 years, many of which were unanticipated.  <br/><br/>The project will encompass three main activities. First, it will conduct a Grand Challenges survey of the scientific community to allow for broad participation and input. Second, it will host a special session at a relevant research conference to allow for community engagement through a combination of retrospective talks and prospective talks about emerging tools and research directions. Finally, it will organize a workshop to synthesize the Grand Challenges and address the primary questions. Participants will include predominantly early career scientists in addition to some who were part of the original Freshwater Imperative. The workshop will involve scientists with a range of expertise related to freshwater environments, and will use team science approaches to develop products that will inform the scientific community about critical unanswered questions, as well as provide guidance to policy makers. <br/><br/>The workshop is supported by the Ecosystem Science program in the Division of Environmental Biology and the Hydrologic Sciences program in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To date, over 1,000 species have been discovered in this remarkable amber. Scientific study of Dominican amber began with an NSF-funded expedition by Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) entomologist Milton Sanderson, who visited the island in 1959 to study beetles. Having learned of rich amber deposits he set out to find them with the help of local guides and collected a large sample that he brought back to the INHS. The following year he published a short paper reporting his discovery, thereby kickstarting scientific study of this ancient ecosystem. Sanderson's collection is therefore, tremendously important both scientifically and historically, yet remains unstudied, still unsorted and unprocessed in the original five-gallon buckets in which it was collected. Years of substandard storage has taken its toll on the amber, which has undergone significant oxidation and is now incredibly fragile. This project will allow the collection to finally be screened for inclusions, conserved using state-of-the-art resin embedding techniques, curated, and digitized. This will unlock a wealth of important data concerning ancient biodiversity, ecology, and climate that is currently hidden and inaccessible within the collection.  In addition to making this data available to the scientific community and the public for the first time, it will also provide valuable experience to graduate and undergraduate students beginning their careers in science.<br/><br/>The Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) at the University of Illinois is home to the Milton Sanderson Dominican Amber Collection (MSDAC).  In addition to its historical importance as the first substantial collection of Dominican amber, the MSDAC is hugely significant scientifically.  It comprises a large (ca. 70 kg) bulk sample of amber that remains almost entirely unprocessed; i.e., it still resides in the five-gallon buckets in which it was collected and has yet to be screened for fossils.  Aside from its size, the unscreened nature of the collection means that it has not been subject to collector bias and no inclusions have been discarded, as typically happens in collections made commercially and sold to museums or private collectors.  As a result, the MSDAC presents a unique opportunity to study an unbiased collection that promises to deliver a more complete picture of the paleobiodiversity and paleoecology of the Early Miocene Dominican amber forest. Unfortunately, decades of substandard storage have resulted in substantial oxidation damage putting the collection at significant risk. This project will focus on the stabilization, conservation, curation and digitization of the MSDAC. A state-of-the-art vacuum resin embedding technique, in which specimens are embedded in a high-quality synthetic resin, will be used to stabilize the oxidized amber. Trimming and polishing of stabilized specimens will allow identification of inclusions and facilitate photomicrography of specimens for inclusion in an online database. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in every step of the process, thereby helping to train the next generation of scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
