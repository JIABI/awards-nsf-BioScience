This wealth of data creates the opportunity to address a pressing need, namely to explore the patterns and drivers of infectious disease emergence in humans and natural ecosystems at global scales. This project will create a Research Coordination Network to bring together internationally recognized experts from ecology, conservation medicine, parasitology and computational sciences to quantify and explore the drivers of global scale patterns of pathogen biodiversity. Participants will work together to assemble data sets of unprecedented size, including information about disease occurrence in host species ranging from insects to humans. With help from experts in machine learning (artificial intelligence) and geographic information systems (GIS), they will work to build predictive models that can be used to understand the changing distributions of infectious diseases and identify future hotspots of novel disease emergence in humans and wildlife.<br/><br/>Emerging infectious diseases, especially those that jump from wildlife to livestock and humans, threaten public health around the world. Using state of the art computational methods, the RCN will be able to answer critical questions such as: How and why do certain pathogens successfully move from one host species to another? Are hotspots of pathogen biodiversity in wildlife the same areas as hotspots of disease emergence in humans and livestock? To share its findings, the RCN will develop educational products such as webcasts and workshops aimed at educational levels from high school to post graduate, and will train students from under-represented groups through a summer research program. The RCN will also develop and maintain databases of global infectious disease biodiversity and make these data freely available to the academic community and the general public."

While our understanding of the spread of COVID-19 is still evolving, policymakers need to make strategic decisions amidst this uncertainty to mitigate the pandemic. Appropriate policy decisions can reduce morbidity, mortality, and damage to the healthcare system. This study will estimate the underlying prevalence of COVID-19 at the county level and project future trajectories of COVID-19 under various sequences of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions. In addition, these new estimations and projections will be incorporated into our existing online COVID-19 Simulator (www.covid19sim.org) to inform county-level decisions. In addition, the COVID-19 Simulator will detect early signs of community-level COVID-19 outbreaks and predict hotspots in different jurisdictions. From a societal perspective, this research will improve our understanding of COVID-19 transmission and inform policies to mitigate the spread of the virus, ultimately leading to a reduction in COVID-19 disease burden.<br/><br/>This research will use epidemiological and operations research modeling approaches to simulate the spread of COVID-19 at the county level and the effects of different interventions on mitigation of COVID-19. In addition, causal decision tree and mixed-integer programing-based machine learning algorithms will be used to identify county level hotspots of transmission. The proposed research will not only inform key decisions with important public health implications, but also contribute to intellectual merits, including 1) linking and using various datasets in near real-time to improve our understanding of disease epidemiology, 2) estimating the underlying prevalence of COVID-19 and projecting future trajectories under various interventions, 3) developing innovative approaches for real time parameter estimations,  model calibrations, and projections, and (4) detecting early signs of community-level COVID-19 outbreaks using epidemiological, statistical and machine learning based modeling techniques.<br/><br/>This RAPID award is made by the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases Program in the Division of Environmental Biology, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historically, behavioral adaptation has played a central role in the progression of epidemics. In some cases, a change in behavior may suppress an epidemic (e.g., through fear-driven flight or self-isolation) while in other cases, a change may intensify the spread of a disease (e.g., through vaccine refusal or premature cessation of distancing). People?s future behavior during the current COVID-19 epidemic will determine how well we cope with two central threats. First is the immediate threat of successive epidemic waves due to the premature lifting of social distancing guidelines, and the abandonment of social distancing by a large percentage of the population. The second threat is that the disease will rebound even after a vaccine is available. This has occurred before (e.g., measles) and could occur with COVID-19 if a sufficient fraction of the population refuses vaccine out of fear. This research will develop a new model to predict human behavior using publicly available social media data to address a known weakness in most current models.  The new model, source code, data, parameters, assumptions, and methods will all be completely open and publicly available, ensuring the replicability of all results. This project will also deliver an interactive version of the model for use by policymakers, government agencies, and educators. Other broader impacts are training opportunities for a graduate student. <br/><br/>Most current models that are used to forecast the course of epidemics may provide incomplete results because they do not take into account changes in peoples? behavior (human behavioral adaptation).  In the proposed research, human behavior will be included within a new model using data taken from social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. The data will allow calibration of the model and replicate the entire New York State epidemic to date. Machine Learning approaches will be applied to determine optimal messages and interventions over a wide range of scenarios and control strategies.

COVID-19, which emerged out of the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 is now spreading in multiple countries. It is particularly concerning that the case fatality rate appears to be higher for the novel coronavirus than for seasonal influenza, and especially so for older populations and those with prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Any plan for stopping the epidemic must be based on a quantitative understanding of the proportion of the at-risk population that needs to be protected by effective control measures in order for transmission to decline sufficiently and quickly enough for the epidemic to end. Different data collection and testing modalities and strategies available to help calibrate transmission models and predict the spread/severity of a disease, have variable costs, response times, and accuracies. In this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project, the team will examine the problem of establishing optimal practices for rapid testing for the novel coronavirus. The result will be the Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM), which will translate into science-based predictions of the COVID-19 epidemic's characteristics, including the duration and overall size, and help the global efforts to combat the disease. The RTEM will fill an important gap in data-driven decision making during the COVID-19 epidemic and, thus, will enable services with significant national economic and health impact. The educational impact of the project will be on mentoring of post-doctoral and PhD researchers and on curricula by incorporating research challenges and outcomes into existing undergraduate and graduate classes. <br/><br/>Computational models for the spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging infectious diseases and data- and model-driven computer simulations for disease spreading are increasingly critical in predicting geo-temporal evolution of epidemics as well as designing, activating, and adapting practices for controlling epidemics. In this project, the researchers tackle a Rapid Testing for Epidemic Modeling (RTEM) problem: Given a partially known target disease model and a set of testing modalities (from surveys to surveillance testing at known disease hotspots), with varying costs, accuracies, and observational delays, what is the best rapid testing strategy that would help recover the underlying disease model? Several scientific questions arise: What is the value of testing? Should only sick people be tested for virus detection? What level of resources should be devoted to the development of highly accurate tests (low false positives, low false negatives)? Is it better to use only one type of test aiming at the best cost/effectiveness trade off, or a non-homogeneous testing policy? Naturally these questions need to be investigated at the interface of epidemiology, computer science, machine learning, mathematical modeling and statistics. As part of the work, the team will develop a model of transmission dynamics and control, tailored to COVID-19 in a way that accommodates diagnostic testing with varying fidelities and delays underlying a rapid testing regimen. The investigators will further integrate the resulting RTEM-SEIR model with EpiDMS and DataStorm for executing continuous coupled simulations. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded through the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Diseases program (Division of Environmental Biology) and the Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation program (Engineering).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite its remarkable stability, DNA undergoes a multitude of chemical modifications in cells. These include various types of DNA damage but also regulatory modifications such as epigenetic marks. Left unchecked, DNA damage interferes with replication, potentially impairing the transmission of vital genetic information. Conversely, epigenetic marks in critical regions of the genome are essential for regulated gene expression, cell differentiation and normal development. Consequently, the biochemical pathways restoring genome integrity are intertwined with pathways that alter the epigenetic state of DNA. The project will unveil fundamental mechanisms governing the interrogation, extrusion, and coordinated processing of modified DNA bases that link DNA demethylation pathways to base excision repair. The project blends research with curriculum enrichment and student training in high performance computing and data-driven computational science, highlighted by a new project-driven course, ?Computation in the Biosciences: Modeling the Machines of Life?, aligned with Georgia State University?s initiative to promote experiential learning.<br/><br/>The research employs molecular simulation technologies, novel path optimization and enhanced sampling methodologies, large-scale supercomputing resources, and experimental analysis through collaborations to gain mechanistic insights into base excision repair and DNA demethylase enzymes. The specific goals are to: 1) uncover key principles underpinning the ability of glycosylase enzymes to select epigenetic marks or lesioned DNA bases; 2) elucidate the protein-nucleic acid interactions ensuring enzyme specificity; 3) delineate handoffs from one enzyme to the next in the pathway, which prevents accumulation of toxic intermediates. Broader impacts include knowledge that could enable modulation of enzyme activities through small molecules or rational design, as well as student training with a focus on underrepresented minority students gaining analytic and computational competencies through research and coursework.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and Molecular Biophysics programs of the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division in the Biological Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells contain diverse organelles that play specific roles and interact with other functional units. By developing hybrids of living cells with synthetic parts (cyborgs), this project provides an innovative approach to understand modularity. Immediate goals are to develop artificial cytoskeletons to allow control of cell shape and organization upon command, offering insights into basic cellular processes. This project also examines societal impacts to inform the team's researchers and to help prepare public presentations to increase broader impacts. This work should spark public discussion on the role of hybrid organisms in society and will examine public concerns of producing something 'unnatural.' Additional impacts include training a highly interdisciplinary research team, with intensive mentoring in each group and across groups. The topic will engage the public and provide opportunity for numerous outreach projects and public events.<br/><br/>How cellular processes can be explained by modularity remains poorly understood, partly because of the lack of tools for manipulating whole organelles. The project focuses on developing two types of artificial cytoskeletons (synCyto) that can be introduced into living cells and controlled experimentally, based on: 1) Spirostomum myonemes and (2) Magnetic particles (Magnetic Robotic Swarms). The prediction is that these will form dynamic assemblages inside of cells that can be controllable experimentally through inputs such as light or magnetic fields to change cell shape and move other organelles. This work provides proof of principle towards developing hybrid cells with multiple synthetic organelles. Such synthetic organelles promise to provide prosthetic function to replace or augment native organelles, and have the potential to confer new and enhanced cellular functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Dr. Jered M. Wendte is ""The Epigenomic Consequences of Increased Heterochromatin Load in Maize"". The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Georgia and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Robert J. Schmitz.<br/><br/>A major problem facing humanity is the production of an adequate food supply for an exponentially increasing population. One promising strategy to address this problem is the modification of crop plant genomes to produce crop varieties with higher yields and desirable traits through genome engineering. Plant genomes are comprised of several long stretches of DNA, termed chromosomes. Each chromosome encodes thousands of genes, which provide the blueprint of an organism. This project will advance genome engineering technologies in the important cereal crop, maize, by evaluating two potential genome engineering strategies. The first involves the possibility of adding entirely new chromosomes to maize as a means to introduce desirable traits that are encoded by multiple genes. The second involves adding genes that encode proteins that chemically modify DNA to maize as a means to increase trait diversity in maize, which can then be selected on for desirable traits, such as drought or disease resistance. Training objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, and science communication.  Broader impacts include participation in existing programs directed at introducing Hispanic and Native American communities to opportunities in plant genomics sciences. <br/><br/>Epigenetic modification of chromatin plays a critical role in the maintenance of genomic stability by targeting repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (TEs), for heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. In plants, which are characterized by relatively large genomes mostly comprised of TEs that are targeted for heterochromatin formation, heterochromatin also plays an important role in phenotypic diversity. Between plant species, there is remarkable variation in the amount and distribution heterochromatin modifications within genomes. Also, within species, heritable changes in chromatin state, or epialleles, account for an important source of phenotypic variability. However, mechanistic explanations for these phenomena, including factors that influence variation in overall heterochromatin capacity and the initiating events that lead to epiallele formation, are currently lacking. Using advanced genomics techniques and novel genetic resources in maize, this project will address these knowledge gaps by 1) determining if a cell?s capacity for heterochromatin is limited, and what factors could be rate limiting by assessing the impacts of the introduction of large, multi-megabase quantities of genetic material in the form of supernumerary B chromosomes on maize heterochromatin structure; and 2) identifying the determinates of methyltransferase targeting and their role in the initiating events of epiallele formation by assessing the heterologous expression of DNA methyltransferases in maize.  All data will be made available through public repositories including NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and the host laboratory website (http://schmitzlab.genetics.uga.edu/data). If successful, this project will provide new important information that can be applied to help guide crop genome engineering design strategies for artificial chromosomes that have minimal detrimental impacts on heterochromatin regulatory pathways. Project outcomes will also help assess the potential of strategies for modulation of the epigenome to induce phenotypic variability that can be selected on for desirable traits.<br/><br/>Keywords: maize, epigenetics, DNA methylation, heterochromatin, artificial chromosomes, genome engineering<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The species being examined are nudibranch sea slugs, which have highly accessible nervous systems that allow experiments to be conducted that are not feasible in other types of animals. The brains of nudibranchs contain only about 10,000 nerve cells (neurons), many of which can be individually identified from animal to animal within a species. Furthermore, neurons can often be identified across different species. Electrical activity can be recorded from multiple neurons to reveal neural circuitry. The connectivity of those circuits can be compared across species. This research team found that although the species have the same sets of neurons, they are wired up differently, even when the species produce similar behaviors. One goal of the project is to artificially rewire the neurons in one species to produce the neural circuit of another species and to create mathematical models that do the same. This will establish how easy it is to convert the behavior of one species into that of another. It also contributes to understanding the basic rules for generating behavior by comparing across species instead of focusing on a single species. The project engages the public by soliciting observations of nudibranch behavior from divers around the world through social media. It also provides important research opportunities to under-represented students through a research pipeline and creates resources that will be available to the scientific community to aid in identifying neurons and mapping out circuits.<br/><br/>Evolvability reflects the ability to evolve. This project examines the features of neural circuits that affect the evolvability of swimming behaviors in nudibranchs. The project uses a variety of techniques to achieve its goals. First, transcriptomics is used to resolve the phylogeny of the Nudibranchia and allow phylogenic hypotheses to be tested. The brain transcriptomes further aid in the discovery of molecular markers for identified neurons, which are needed particularly in species that do not swim.  Electrophysiological techniques are used to search for ""latent"" circuitry, that is, connectivity that might be present in non-swimmers and potentially activated by small changes. These changes will be applied using the dynamic clamp technique to inject artificial synaptic and membrane conductances and through ectopic expression of serotonin receptors. Finally, mathematical simulations are used to examine the consequences of different circuit architectures and their robustness for rhythmic activity."

There has been much research to understand the evolution of morphological structures (e.g., shape, color, size). However, far less is known about the evolution of novel biochemical adaptations and the impact of these adaptations on the biodiversity of the organisms in which they appear. Of particular interest is how these traits arise if they are costly to the individuals who harbor them. This research investigates the evolution of biochemical adaptations and the genetic and ecological mechanisms that shape them. The research explores the tolerance of insects (fruit flies) to potent toxins in mushrooms that they consume. By investigating the mechanism of toxin tolerance and how this unique adaptation is maintained in this model system, the research will enhance the general understanding of how novel traits emerge and shape biodiversity. This project also includes activities designed to increase public scientific literacy and familiarity with biodiversity by training teachers and students, from middle school to the undergraduate level (particularly from underrepresented minorities), and generating photographic identification guides for insect species associated with mushrooms.<br/><br/>Flies from some groups of Drosophila feed on both toxic and non-toxic mushrooms, and can tolerate high doses of potent cyclopeptide mushroom toxins that are deadly to most other multi-cellular organisms. This research tests hypotheses that predict that: 1) tolerance to these toxic cyclopeptides evolved multiple times; 2) the genetic mechanism of tolerance is not the same in all species; and 3) trade-offs between the physiological costs of tolerance and the benefits of access to a low-competition resource maintain tolerance. The mechanisms of tolerance and their evolution within different fly species are being characterized using metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses that are analyzed in a phylogenetic framework. To assess the genetic basis of variation in toxin tolerance, the researchers are performing artificial selection experiments and genome sequencing. Finally, observational and competition experiments are being used to identify how selective pressures maintain toxin tolerance in natural populations. In sum, this research will provide an in-depth evolutionary, ecological, and physiological assessment of a costly and novel biochemical adaptation, and its impact on biodiversity."

Due to the rapid onset of the pandemic, BIO-REU principal investigators (PIs) were caught largely unprepared to deliver REU learning through distance technologies. This proposal will capitalize of the organizing activities started by BIO-REU PIs to provide distance REU programs. Specifically, PIs are making substantial changes to their programs to engage students in research at a distance, including shifting to research projects that can be conducted at a distance, offering research mentoring and professional development online, and providing informal avenues for communication at a distance. The shift to distance programming is both necessary and unprecedented. Substantive evaluation is needed in order to refine these approaches to maximize student learning and minimize disruption to REU offerings, which play a critical role in developing the research workforce. This project will improve student learning and development in distance BIO-REU sites by carrying out such an evaluation. First, the distance REUs will be evaluated early in their programming through virtual focus groups with students and mentors as well as observations of synchronous, distance activities. The results of these evaluations will be reported rapidly to the BIO-REU PIs to enable prompt adjustments and refinements of distance program activities. Then, additional focus group and survey data will be collected to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to (a) build a sense of community in their cohorts, (b) ensure student ownership of their research projects, (c) provide quality mentorship at a distance, and (d) influence students? professional growth and their education and career interests. Data will be compared across REU sites and with published studies of in-person REU sites to identify strategies useful for improving student learning in distance REUs. Results will be shared in reports to each REU site in order to make improvements and published for the undergraduate STEM education community to apply lessons learned in future undergraduate research programming. <br/><br/>This project will accomplish two major goals: (1) evaluating distance REUs in order to improve student learning and research workforce development and (2) producing new knowledge about the effectiveness of distance REU programming. Using established approaches and measurements for evaluating undergraduate research experiences, the project will involve conducting focus groups, observing program activities, and collecting survey data from undergraduate researchers and their research mentors at REU sites across the country that are operating at a distance due to COVID19. Results from analysis of focus groups and observations will be rapidly reported to REU site leaders to make immediate improvements to better support student learning. Results from surveys and focus groups will be used to determine the extent to which distance REUs are able to achieve similar goals to in-person REUs, including building a sense of community, ensuring robust student involvement in research, providing quality mentorship at a distance, and influencing students? professional growth and their education and career interests. The project will produce tested strategies for engaging undergraduates in research at a distance, which could be applied to other circumstances such as serving students who are not able to travel to a distant REU site or engaging students following natural disasters.

Furthermore, the diversity of the network members inspires the creation of an equally diverse set of resources and intervention strategies that are applicable within and beyond the biological sciences and across institutional contexts. Building on previous RCN-UBE incubator funding (DBI 1827160), we will: 1) Develop resources and instructional materials to aid students in cultivating academic resilience; 2) Support travel for network members during implementation and dissemination of interventions; 3) Expand FLAMEnet membership with annual workshops to share results, develop and refine academic interventions, and promote dissemination of interventions to colleagues at network member institutions.

Undergraduate researchers report gains in their ability to think and work like scientists and increased interest in and enjoyment of science. They are also more likely to pursue further education and careers in science and research, which drive the nation's progress and economic prosperity. Yet, research experiences are typically structured as internships, which limits the number of students who can participate. In response, colleges and universities have begun to transform their laboratory courses into scalable research experiences, called Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs). Students who participate in CUREs achieve many of the same gains as students who participate in research internships, but there are colleges and universities that have yet to integrate CUREs into their undergraduate curricula - especially colleges and universities that enroll significant proportions of students from under-represented and under-served backgrounds. The CURE Network 2 (CUREnet 2) will take a multi-pronged approach to build capacity for CUREs at Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs) and other under-resourced colleges and universities. As a result, broader and more diverse populations of students will have access to research experiences. CUREnet 2 will also support networking and collaboration to understand what makes CUREs effective for student learning and development and to maximize the effectiveness, impact, and long-term sustainability of CURE instruction.<br/><br/>CUREnet 2 aims to support the national shift in undergraduate lab instruction toward student engagement in research. CUREnet 2 is designed in response to educational needs and according to theories of change in higher education, thereby maximizing its likelihood of impact and success. With leadership representing seven universities and colleges, including four HBCUs, CUREnet 2 will build national capacity for CURE instruction by: (1) Offering campus-based faculty professional development on CURE instruction; (2) Supporting the development of cross-institution CUREs and acquisition of resources needed to support undergraduate research; (3) Convening meetings to synthesize research in education, cognitive science, psychology, and learning sciences to understand how CUREs influence student learning and development and to plan collaborations to develop needed assessment frameworks, methods, and tools; (4) Convening meetings to identify problems and solutions for sustaining CUREs over time; (5) Improving the functionality, sustainability, and widespread use of the CUREnet website; and (6) Sharing information and resources among CURE-related networks.

To counter these invaders, plants deploy a robust and effective immune system capable of detecting, appropriately responding to and restricting the proliferation of most microbes. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the detection of microbes and the signaling mechanisms associated with the induction of immunity are understood in ever increasing detail, the molecular mechanism(s) by which microbial proliferation is restricted by immune functions have been elusive. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the bacterial mechanisms targeted by plant immune action. Immune-activated plants appear to limit available sulfur, an essential element for life, thus blocking bacterial proliferation. Plant immunity also interferes with conserved bacterial responses to stress, resulting in the increased sensitization of bacteria to immune outputs. Characterizing these potential modes of immune action will have broad implications for our understanding of plant immunity and provide new targets and practical strategies to manage plant diseases. The project's broad educational goals include increasing pre-graduate competency in plant pathology, teaching plant and plant disease science to students from all backgrounds, including non-science majors, and enhancing scientific understanding through inquiry-based learning. The project's broader impacts expand public knowledge of plant diseases and may suggest new crop protection solutions. <br/><br/><br/>Driven by host recognition of conserved microbe-associated molecular patterns, Pattern Triggered Immunity (PTI) is the first line of induced immune defenses used by plants against invading pathogens.  PTI plays a key role in restricting the unchecked growth of microbes. However, the mechanisms by which PTI restricts the growth of broad classes of microbes are unclear. The transcriptional response of bacterial pathogens to PTI is the basis for this project's focus on mechanisms of PTI action that restrict pathogen growth.  Deploying plant genetics, forward and reverse bacterial genetics, chemical and protein analysis, and bacterial transcriptomics, this CAREER project will test the following hypotheses: 1) Apoplastic sulfate sequestration restricts bacterial proliferation during PTI; 2) PTI outputs interfere with activation of the AlgU bacterial stress response cascade, resulting in increased bacterial sensitization to immune-associated stressors; and 3) although PTI outputs are multifaceted and semi-redundant, bacterial responses to PTI can be used to delineate and link specific outputs to sectors of the plant defense network. This project incorporates educational activities aimed at raising public knowledge about plant diseases and immunity and will focus on the education of non-specialist students. These goals will be achieved by the development of two undergraduate inquiry-based learning courses incorporating plant disease agricultural biotechnology concepts and targeted towards non-science majors, and by piloting peer-mentored, inquiry-based learning lesson plans about plant-microbe interactions for teachers in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, middle schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how these viral associations evolve is thus essential for a holistic view on the evolution of a broad diversity of organisms. Parasitoid wasps (wasps that grow within and kill other insects) are a natural laboratory for understanding the evolution of viral symbiosis because they are highly diverse and have evolved repeated associations with viruses. These viruses are able to suppress the immune defense mechanisms of the insect hosts that are parasitized by the wasps, enabling the wasps to survive and reproduce. Parasitoid wasps also provide substantial economic benefits to society because they are natural enemies of insect pests that cause damage to forests and agricultural crops. This project investigates the evolution and interactions between one of the most astonishing radiations on Earth (braconid parasitoid wasps, with 19,000 species) and the massive untapped diversity of their symbiotic viruses. The long-term goal is to understand the rules that govern the associations of the viruses, the wasps, and the hosts of the wasps. This research project advances knowledge in several ways: (1) discovery of new biodiversity in two poorly studied areas of the tree of life--viruses and wasps; (2) resolution of the evolutionary history and age of wasp-viral symbioses; (3) discovery of predictive genomic traits for viral symbiosis to understand the rules that govern these interactions; (4) characterization of the function of viruses; and (5) generating publicly available genome data. The proposed work will substantially transform understanding of symbiotic viral evolution, which will provide general information about virus evolution. The researchers will integrate wasp and viral research with education and public outreach by working closely with teachers in local schools and developing new educational resources. Furthermore, the program will improve STEM education and educator development and increase public literacy and engagement in STEM.<br/><br/>This project integrates phylogenetic, functional, and genomics approaches to discover the rules that govern mutualistic associations between viruses and wasps and, in turn, the interactions between these parasitoid wasps and their hosts. The overall objectives are to resolve and date the evolutionary relationships of the wasp family Braconidae using new methods of DNA analysis, discover which wasp lineages are associated with mutualistic viruses and the timing of their domestication, determine how viruses affect the antagonistic interactions between the wasps and their hosts, and examine genome features related to viral mutualism. The researchers aim to: (1) Resolve and date deep and shallow nodes for one of the most diverse lineages (19,000 species) on Earth; (2) Discover and characterize the multiple origins of viral symbiosis in Braconidae; and (3) decipher the roles of viral symbionts in the biology of the parasitoid wasps and their hosts. The outreach plan has two main components: 1) Providing research internships in the lab for local K-12 teachers so that they may learn new research techniques that will improve their teaching; and 2) using immersive virtual reality and animation experiences to engage the public and enhance learning in undergraduate education. The researchers will also provide integrated research and training opportunities to underrepresented mentees (2 postdoctoral researchers, 7 undergraduate and 2 graduate students) across the disciplines of phylogenetics, functional and comparative genomics, and revisionary systematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their specialization, individuals in this scenario are adapted to utilize resources in different ways. However, matings between individuals from differently specialized populations are expected to produce intermediate forms that may not be able to survive well in any environment. One solution to this problem is achieved when variation within a species becomes completely associated with variant, or altered, forms of a chromosome. When variant forms of a chromosome contain multiple genes that are inherited as a single unit, this chromosome region is known as a ""supergene"". A growing body of evidence suggests that supergenes play key roles in innovation across the tree of life. Under the influence of a supergene, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta displays two social forms that differ in how many queens inhabit the ant colony and many other individual, colony, and life-history traits. Many of these differences relate to distinct strategies of colony founding by young queens. This research program will assess how variation in diet, nutrition, and supergene presence shape variation in behavior and reproduction in fire ant queens. This will shed new light on supergene origins and function in fire ants, a model for how supergenes can mediate variation in behavior and reproduction in this and other species as well. Broader impacts of the program include partnering with a local high school to offer experiential learning modules and summer research assistantships, integration of resulting data into undergraduate coursework, and providing new insights into the reproductive biology of an economically important invasive species. <br/><br/>This project will explore the extent to which gene expression differences between queens of alternate social forms in Solenopsis invicta reflect convergence with nutritional plasticity, and thus implicate genetic accommodation. In other words, the research will test the hypothesis that a nutritional ground plan played a key role in the origin of queen polymorphism (and, hence, colony social polymorphism) in S. invicta. This work will provide important insights into the proximal basis of queen polymorphism (i) by decoupling gene expression differences due to variation in nutrition and supergene genotype in individual tissues of S. invicta and (ii) by decoupling the effects of queen genotype (endogenous genetic effects) and colony worker genotypes (indirect social genetic effects) on the mediation of queen polymorphism. Taken together, this work will greatly improve our understanding of how phenotypic plasticity and supergenes mediate a complex behavioral polymorphism important in ant social evolution. Broader impacts of the research program include providing fundamental new information on the genomic and epigenomic factors that regulate the reproductive biology of an important invasive pest species, partnering with a local high school biology teacher to develop new experiential learning modules and to provide summer research assistantships for students in the investigator's laboratories, and integrating the data generated by the project into undergraduate coursework.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is not fully understood how the diversity in root architecture contributes to crop yields or plant biomass in part because roots are buried underground and difficult to study. This research takes a quantitative approach to analyze the wide diversity of root architectures. Bean roots grown under experimental conditions will be imaged and the resulting data will be used to create new mathematical and computational tools to discern causes of root variability. Combined with genomic information, the analytical tools will identify genetic elements underlying root shapes in response to environmental and genetic variation. The research will point to new opportunities for breeding targets in crops such as bean and extended to maize. The research also couples with an education program that integrates computation with plant research, thus addressing the critical national need for a computationally trained plant science workforce. The novel tools will be publicly available and deployed using national cyberinfrastructure: further the technologies will be integrated into two courses that enable basic science and computational biology within an experiential learning environment. A new student award is implemented through the Plant Center and the Georgia Informatics Institute to highlight advances attained by working at the computational and plant science interface. Together, the integration of science and education sets forth a path for fast dissemination of results into breeding programs. <br/><br/>After decades of research on plant roots it is still a mystery how and why root architecture arises in seemingly endless variations of shapes. The research introduces the phenotypic spectrum as a new quantitative theory that extends the established concept of plasticity by a new dimension. The phenotypic spectrum of one genotype consists of distinct root architecture types, each of which is hypothesized to be associated with a different plasticity curve across environments. Theoretically, the phenotypic spectrum emerges for a population of one genotype if all elementary geometric measurements at all locations within each individual root system are taken and each individual is summarized by a whole root descriptor. Descriptors with similar characteristics correspond to one architecture type. Hence, the spectrum is not observable with current phenotyping tools that capture only one location in a root system per trait. Quantifying the phenotypic spectrum demands the development of unprecedented whole root descriptors and simulation techniques to capture the differences in the 3D spatial organization of the whole root architecture. In doing so, a new combination of differential geometry and imaging approaches as well as a newly developed statistical analysis is proposed. The experiments will provide an understanding of how to describe and evaluate the interplay of different root architecture types in the greenhouse and the field by linking both with the developed descriptors. The educational goal is to increase the number of researchers at the interface of computational and plant sciences through two courses using the developed tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study of coupled oscillators and their mutual synchronization has remained a problem central to physics for centuries, but has only recently captured the imagination of biologists. One example of synchronized oscillators are the biological clocks found in living cells. Biological clocks are pervasive in their effects from genes to ecosystems. Biological clocks affect the health of humans, animals and plants and they are being engineered for timed delivery of therapeutics, algal bioreactors for biofuel production, and crop improvement. The clock, through its light entrainment feature, impacts the genetic dynamics of bacterial assemblages in the world's oceans and hence may affect carbon cycling in marine ecosystems. Understanding how cell populations synchronize their clock oscillations, to give rise to a functioning ""biological clock"", is the central focus of this project. The project will also develop an innovative interdisciplinary ""Clock Collaboratorium"" graduate student research training course that will make extensive use of cyber-learning tools. Investigators will invite undergraduate and high school students to their labs to work on research related to this project. <br/><br/>Recent evidence suggests that single-cell oscillators of the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa (N. crassa) are stochastic on a single-cell level, while measurements on populations of millions of cells indicate that their clocks are synchronized. In order to understand this synchronization, a novel droplet microfluidics platform is deployed for high-throughput, high-precision measurements on a controlled number of living N. crassa cells. Single-cell measurements will confirm whether circadian rhythms exist on a single-cell level and the extent of stochasticity. Multi-cell experiments will probe communications and synchronization between single-cell clock oscillators. Signaling molecules responsible for synchronization will be identified using nuclear magnetic resonance on exo-metabolites from living cells. Stochastic resonance, a fundamental concept from non-linear-systems physics, will be tested as a possible clock synchronization mechanism, against multi-cell measurements, using novel ensemble simulation modeling approaches. This project is is expected to advance systems biology research on clock systems through (1) tight coupling of modeling and experimentation, and (2) opening up a new frontier by pushing the scale of measurements to single cells. A detailed understanding of the clock's single-cell regulation in N. crassa will provide new insights into clock mechanisms, regulatory clock controls, and physiological consequences in other organisms, ranging from plants to humans."

A matrix of model systems consisting of bacteria-phytoplankton co-cultures will be used as biological assays for key metabolites based on expression patterns of bacterial transporter genes. The chemical identity of candidate metabolites and evaluation of their potential ecological role will be carried out by exometabolomic analysis of co-cultures with bacterial transporter mutants. Both advanced mass spectrometry and NMR will be used for metabolomics analysis, taking advantage of the sensitivity and compound identification strengths of each. The distribution of candidate metabolites in the ocean microbiome and other microbial systems will be characterized by mining environmental sequence datasets for orthologous transporter genes. This project represents a novel approach to identifying metabolites important in microbiome function, compounds often difficult to address with standard chemical approaches because of their low concentrations and high biological demand."

Historically, a mechanistic understanding of ecologically important phenotypes has been limited to a small number of genes in very few model organisms. The research will improve genetic tools in the wildflower genus Mimulus (monkeyflowers), a system that exhibits rich diversity in form, physiology, and life history. By connecting this diversity with functional genetic analysis and field experiments, the research will enable molecular genetic investigations of previously unexplored of phenotypic variation. With the tools proposed here, the growing Mimulus scientific community will be in an excellent position to identify the causal genetic mechanisms underlying ecologically important traits. The research will provide hands-on learning opportunities for two different undergraduate laboratory courses taught at University of Georgia and University of California, Riverside. In addition, the research will offer training experiences for local high school teachers in Georgia to develop and refine lab activities for dissemination in the high school classroom. Furthermore, the plant materials generated in this research will be incorporated into live plant outreach activities at the University of Connecticut for student and public education. Finally, the actives will be broadly disseminated via the Plant Biology section on the ""Learn.Genetics"" website as online educational resources.<br/><br/>Identifying the genetic and developmental determinants of natural phenotypic variation is fundamentally important for understanding organismal biology and the processes that generate biodiversity. The genus Mimulus is an exceptionally diverse group of approximately 200 wildflower species with abundant natural populations that is ideally suited for linking naturally occurring genotypes to their ecologically important phenotypes. The research will enable Mimulus as a powerful new model for ecological functional genomics and plant developmental genetics. The specific scientific objectives are as follows: 1) Optimize genetic transformation protocols in seven Mimulus species that are actively studied by many researchers and represent a wide range of phylogenetic diversity. 2) Generate large-scale chemical and transposon insertion mutant libraries for three of the most actively studied species. Additionally, a major goal of the research is to enable Mimulus researchers to take full advantage of the newly developed functional genomics protocols and resources in their own labs. This project includes an annual, weeklong summer lab short course that will rotate between the University of Connecticut and the University of Georgia. The project will also include a website to disseminate detailed instructions and video tutorials of protocols, as well as a searchable database with information on plant lines, seed stocks, and other important tools generated from this work.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by funds from Enabling Discovery through GEnomic Tools (EDGE) Program and the Evolutionary Process Program within the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there is strong support for neuroscience education within this large and diverse community, the adoption of case studies and PBL methods within neuroscience courses is far less developed. Finding appropriate teaching resources, in part due to the interdisciplinary nature of neuroscience and the rapid growth of neuroscience programs, is a strong challenge. This network will provide collaboration opportunities for educators with a strong interest in using these pedagogies in the classroom and create a platform for the discussion and dissemination of new teaching resources for the broader neuroscience education community. The increased faculty and future faculty collaboration on creating case studies stimulated by the network promises to enhance neuroscience education in all institutional contexts.<br/><br/>The broad objectives of this network are twofold: to provide collaboration opportunities for educators with a strong interest in using these pedagogies in the classroom and to create a platform for the discussion and dissemination of new teaching resources for the broader neuroscience community. The network is organized into cohorts of case writers, each with 6-8 Fellows of whom are experienced in cases/PBL methodologies. These Fellows will work collaboratively to create publishable case studies via focused workshops. The Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education will be a primary vehicle for dissemination of these pedagogical tools to the wider neuroscience education community. The network then provides support for Fellows to create their own peer-mentoring groups which is intended to both support the generation of a new rounds of case writers but more importantly to encourage and promote implementation of case studies and PBL in the classroom. The network will partner with established promotors of neuroscience education, specifically the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience and the Society for Neuroscience to education and inform the community of these new curricular tools. Thus, with the creation of new curricular materials via the case writing Fellows and peer mentoring groups to encourage and support the implementation of these case studies, the network will have a strong impact in promoting pedagogical change in STEM disciplines. <br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/)."

However, for plants living under water-limited conditions, photosynthetic productivity can be reduced by hotter and drier climatic conditions. To counteract these conditions, some plants utilize forms of photosynthesis that increase the efficiency with which they use water. One such innovation seen in plants that grow in deserts or other water-limited habitats is referred to as CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism). The CAM innovation is found in a large number of diverse plant lineages and typically associated with stem (e.g. cacti) or leaf (e.g. agaves) succulence. The proposed research project will use several approaches to address fundamental questions about how plants use CAM and how genes involved in performing CAM are regulated in response to varying environmental conditions. To achieve this, the project will focus on the independent evolution of CAM in the orchid and agave plant families, both of which have species known for their ability to thrive in water-limited environments. This research will provide a foundation for understanding the genetic basis of CAM pathways and potentially transfer to economically important plants for improved water use efficiency under drought conditions leading to improved productivity. Additionally, this project would result in the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from under-represented groups. There are also plans to integrate the results of the project into classroom learning and broader outreach activities.<br/><br/>This project utilizes an integrated research program on two instances of CAM photosynthesis to illuminate the mechanisms that link ecological, genetic and molecular dimensions of the evolutionary processes that contribute to the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Photosynthesis is a fundamental process supporting biodiversity in the vast majority of ecological communities on our planet, while at the same time a physiological challenge for primary producers living under water-limited conditions. The evolutionary history of photosynthetic organisms has included repeated origins of carbon concentrating mechanisms that increase water-use efficiency and productivity in extreme environmental conditions. Crassulacean acid metabolism is one such innovation that has facilitated diversification of vascular plant lineages in an array of habitats. The proposed project will integrate ecological, physiological, phylogenetic, genetic and genomic approaches to address fundamental questions about how plants use CAM and how genes involved in performing CAM are regulated in response to different environmental conditions. The study systems for this project are the species-rich Agavoideae (Asparagaceae) and Oncidiinae (Orchidaceae) lineages, both of which include CAM, C3 (typical form of photosynthesis) and facultative or weak CAM species. These systems will aid in inferring the phylogenetic and environmental context for multiple gains and losses of CAM photosynthesis in both lineages. Comparative analyses of RNA will illuminate the interacting molecular and environmental drivers of shifts between C3 and CAM photosynthesis and the impact of these shifts on the origin and maintenance of species diversity. Furthermore, shifts in gene function associated with the gain and loss of CAM will be tested through genetic analyses of a yucca hybrid, resulting from a natural cross between a CAM and C3 parental species, and experimental manipulations of gene expression in the emerging orchid model species, Erycina pusilla (Oncidiinae)."

Despite these constant adjustments, neurons must also maintain key activity features that are essential for their function. The mechanisms that stabilize the identifying attributes of a given neuron are fundamentally important for nervous system performance, yet they are poorly described. Defining these cellular processes will provide insights into the organization and operation of all neural circuits, and will speak to how nervous systems can produce reliable behaviors while constantly adjusting in response to unique sets of ever-changing perturbations. This research is important because it will advance the quest to understand how the nervous system copes with variability arising from individual differences in genetic, developmental and life histories so that each individual nervous system can produce similar behaviors and respond to perturbations in a like manner. Equally important, this project is designed to train the next generation of scientists, instill a deeper appreciation of science in the public, promote minorities in science and provide a valuable scientific community resource. <br/><br/>This project addresses how low-level modulatory tone stabilizes circuit output over the long-term using a simple model, the crustacean pyloric network. This 14-neuron circuit comprises identifiable neurons with specific activity features. A given attribute is defined by an explicit balance of conductances and is maintained by preserving its underlying conductance correlations. Low levels of monoamines can enable feedback loops that preserve conductance correlations and their corresponding activity features, even when one of the balanced conductances is persistently altered through experimental manipulation. The goal of the research is to elucidate the molecular processes involved in monoamine-enabled maintenance of conductance correlations. Recent studies show that monoamines act through microRNA to persistently influence a conductance correlation and stabilize its corresponding activity feature. A combination of molecular and electrophysiological techniques will be used to identify microRNAs that are regulated by monoaminergic tone and that maintain a specific conductance correlation.  The expression of these microRNAs will then be altered to determine the effects on neuronal and circuit output. An annotated microRNA database will also be developed, hosted on a local server and made freely available."

As genome sequencing can help characterizing this diversity and has recently become routine, most microbial scientists have been overwhelmed by the amount of available data. For many researchers, a complete and thorough analysis of the available genome data is not necessary. Instead, these users would be better served with straightforward methods that can identify their unknown DNA/RNA sequence(s), and be able to discriminate between well-understood taxa and those that are potentially novel. Tools that can help direct researchers to the most ""interesting"" genomes and genes among thousands of candidates will be important. Furthermore, metagenomics, which is the sequencing of environmental DNA, allows the genetic characterization of the majority of these prokaryotes that have resisted cultivation in the laboratory. However, current tools to analyze metagenomic data are clearly lagging behind the development of sequencing technologies (and data processing tools), and are typically limited to genome assembly and gene annotation. This is a major limitation for better understanding, studying and communicating about the biodiversity of uncultivated microorganisms that run the life-sustaining biogeochemical cycles on the planet, form critical associations with their plant and animal hosts, or produce products of biotechnological value. Therefore, new approaches to make the emerging genomic and metagenomic sequence information readily available to the non-expert user are timely and essential in order to advance our understanding of the diversity and function of microbial communities across the fields of ecology, systematics, evolution, engineering, agriculture and medicine.<br/><br/>   The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computational framework to organize and catalogue the genomic and metagenomic information of the ""uncultivated majority"" of bacteria and archaea that will scale-up with the available and forthcoming metagenomic data sets. To achieve this goal, the Microbial Genomes Atlas project (MiGA), which was originally designed to catalogue the diversity among isolate genomes, will be used and expanded with new tools and computational solutions that will allow it to encompass the ""uncultivated majority"". The new tools include -but are not limited to- a kmer-based approach to replace the alignment-based genome-average nucleotide identity (ANI) metric for estimating genetic relatedness among genomes and high-throughput tools for assessing genome completeness and quality, the pangenome of a group of genomes, and the level of genetic variation within natural sequence-discrete populations. This research effort will address critical limitations of the current 16S rRNA gene-based approaches in cataloging microbial diversity (e.g., lack of resolution at the species level and below), and will provide highly needed tools for the online analysis of high throughput genomic and metagenomic data from uncultivated microorganisms. The project will also provide multifaceted learning experiences to both undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of microbiology, evolution, genomics, bioinformatics, and computational biology, a pivotal area of contemporary research and education.

That is, while some species are common, others are rare. Scientists do not fully understand why such differences in the abundance of species exist and in particular how rare species can continue to persist.  As the natural world is dynamic, in order to persist, species must successfully respond to the environmental changes they experience. Possible ways to do this include adaptation and acclimation. Adaptation involves a genetic change in a population over generations. This ability to adapt is influenced by the variation found within a population and this variation may be limited for rare species, which often are found in small numbers. Acclimation involves the ability of an individual within its life-time to adjustment to different conditions. Acclimation may be especially important in the face of rapid environmental change because adaptation takes time. This study will examine how common and rare plant species adapt and acclimate to environmental change to understand how each can persist. The results of this study will help guide the conservation of rare species and will foster collaborations among researchers at botanical gardens and several undergraduate focused universities. This research will support student experiential learning, as well as the mentoring and inclusion of students from underrepresented groups in the natural sciences and community colleges. Finally, this project will also engage the public through science cafs and outreach opportunities at botanical gardens.<br/><br/>The question of why some species are rare while others are common is enduring and has important implications for ecological theory, the conservation of rare species, and the understanding of biodiversity patterns. This study will use a multi-faceted approach to address why some species are rare while others are common. First, to assess the potential acclimatory and adaptive constraints associated with the commonness of species, laboratory experiments using controlled-environments, as well as field surveys, will be conducted to compare the genetic diversity and ecophysiological plasticity found within and across a suite of rare endemic and common congeneric plant species. Second, to frame empirical investigations and understand the traits associated with plant rarity, a comprehensive synthesis of the existing primary literature will be conducted. And third, to predict the performance and persistence of rare species, empirically derived trait and plasticity based data will be used to develop mechanistic trait-based models.

Most crop plants are salt sensitive (glycophytes), and breeding for improved salt tolerance has met with limited success.  A small percentage of flowering plants, however, can complete their life cycle under saline conditions, and are considered halophytes.  Some halophytes are closely related to salt-sensitive crop plants and an investigation of the genetic, morphological, physiological and biochemical differences between glycophytic crops and their halophytic relatives may identify novel mechanisms that can be used to increase the salt tolerance of crops.  Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that glycophytic species related to halophytes may already have most of the basic machinery needed for salt tolerance.  This project will focus on the halophytic turfgrasses seashore paspalum and zoysiagrass, which have leaf adaptations that allow plants to sequester and/or excrete salt, and their salt-sensitive relatives sorghum and finger millet, two cereal crops.  Understanding the genetics behind salt-adaptations in halophytes will ultimately find applications in breeding for enhanced salt tolerance.  Furthermore, the project will be used as a vehicle to train graduate and undergraduate students, and to introduce 6-12 graders to inquiry-based learning and instill in them a passion for plant science. <br/><br/>The project builds on the results of preliminary studies that identified structural adaptations on the leaf surface as well as the presence of novel sulfated glycans as hallmarks of the halophytic grass seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum).

This specialization is driven by the need for parasites to efficiently encounter and infect at least some hosts, which often comes at the cost of being able to infect others. At a broad-scale, parasite species adapt to a particular set of host species. At a finer-scale, many parasite strains specialize at overcoming the defenses of a narrow range of host genotypes within a species. There is little understanding of how evolutionary processes of host and parasite adaptation at the fine scale are linked to the evolution of parasite host ranges at broader scales, in part because few host-parasite systems are amenable to research at both scales. In this project the researchers will capitalize on a natural, ancient host-parasite system that allows for molecular investigation of parasite specialization at multiple scales. Escovopsis is a diverse genus of parasitic fungus that attacks other fungi cultivated by fungus-growing ants. Different Escovopsis species are able to infect different species of cultivated fungi, and at a finer scale, different Escovopsis genotypes are able to infect and utilize different host genotypes. Such parasite specificity suggests a dynamic pattern of adaptation and provides a rare opportunity to identify traits underlying parasite specialization at multiple scales. As part of this project, classes of undergraduate students will study parasite evolution through investigation of the parasites' host ranges and the parasites' genomes, and middle school students will learn about parasite evolution through an integrated science and art approach. <br/><br/>Building on existing knowledge of Escovopsis diversity and host range, as well as recently gained insights into the Escovopsis genome, the researchers will couple experimental assays of parasite-host interactions, transcriptomics, population genomics and genetic manipulation to explore the genetic underpinnings of pathogen specialization. Specifically, the researchers will utilize transcriptomics and functional assays to identify the gene underlying the parasites' responses to host strains that they can and cannot infect. They will study the evolution of these genes in light of the evolution of the rest of the parasite genome through genomic comparisons across species and across strains within species. Taken together, the researchers will be able to assess whether similar traits underlie parasite specialization at broad and fine evolutionary scales in a tractable, ancient host-parasite system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It influences how DNA is inherited from one generation to the next. Organisms actually have many different ways of reproducing.  It is unclear why the most common should involve genetic contributions from two parents (bi-parental reproduction) as opposed to one (uni-parental reproduction). One important consequence of bi-parental reproduction is that it produces more genetically variable offspring.  Why this is an advantage, however, is unclear.  One possibility is that genetically variable offspring are more likely to escape infection from parasites and diseases that have adapted to the parents' genetic make-up. Another is that the genetic variability is helpful more generally for adaptation to changing environments. This project uses the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which can reproduce either uni- or bi-parentally, along with its bacterial parasite, Serratia marcescens, to experimentally test these ideas.  The project will also contribute to teaching and training students at many levels, providing opportunities for them to learn scientific methods in a hands-on fashion. It will integrate research with education in undergraduate teaching labs and will include developing and implementing new teaching laboratory classes. It will also train graduate students. Finally, it will include an outreach program that will bring hypothesis testing science to a neighborhood with many young children from underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>The questions of both how and why bi-parental reproduction is maintained in nature largely remain a mystery in evolutionary biology. Currently, the Red Queen hypothesis (RQH) is the most well supported hypothesis regarding the evolution and maintenance of outcrossing. The central prediction of the RQH is that negative frequency-dependent selection, imposed by coevolving parasites, favors reproduction via outcrossing over self-fertilization in host populations. Although a rapidly growing number of studies demonstrate the ability of coevolving parasites to favor host outcrossing over host self-fertilization, the mode of selection imposed by coevolving parasites, and in general, the coevolutionary dynamics between outcrossing hosts and their respective parasites remain unclear. Here, the fundamental predictions of the RQH will be comprehensively tested in perhaps the only experimental system currently capable of permitting such a test. Specifically, the host, Caenorhabditis elegans, and parasite, Serratia marcescens, populations will be experimentally evolved to determine if coevolving parasites are necessary for the evolution and maintenance of outcrossing, or if only a dynamic changing environment is required. After which, the phenotypic and underlying genetic changes in the hosts and parasites, as well as the mode (or modes) of selection that result from antagonistic coevolution, will be determined through a combination of phenotypic assays, next-generation sequencing, functional genetic testing via transformation, and subsequent experimental evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a rapidly changing world, there is an urgent need to know the conditions necessary for adaptation. In the past, unrelated populations or species independently adapted in similar ways to increased temperatures. The goal of this research is to use such natural experimental replicates to identify ecological, physiological and genetic predictors of adaptation. For animals or plants, it is technically difficult to discover the precise genetic mechanism encoding new traits. This research focuses instead on many wild populations of yeast and includes the model organism for genetics, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which humans also use to ferment food and beverages. Yeast are exceptionally tractable in the laboratory, and there are wild forest populations of even domesticated species with population biology that is surprisingly similar to that of animals. Work on this project will provide an interdisciplinary training that is in high demand by integrating field, laboratory and bioinformatic approaches. It will train undergraduate and graduate students, including students from underrepresented groups in science. Researchers will also test whether the same principles of natural yeast thermal adaptation also governed adaptation of wild yeast to local human-associated environments. Families, elementary school children and others in the community will learn about the concepts and findings of the research through local events and school visits.<br/><br/>Populations that show convergent evolution provide natural replicates for understanding the ecological, phenotypic and molecular basis of adaptation. The research team's overall objective is to identify the mutations and evolutionary processes that characterize convergent evolution in the wild, using thermal adaptation in yeast as the study system. The research will test for convergent thermal evolution within species and across phylogenetic scales by sampling many yeast populations from four woodland species, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Population genomic analyses will distinguish new adaptive mutations from standing genetic variation or gene flow. The power of wild yeast genetics can show the underlying mechanisms of adaptation to an extent that would be almost impossible in any other system. The experiments involve analyses to infer phylogenetic relationships for detecting convergence and evolutionary context; field sampling and physiological screens identifying thermal adaptation in natural yeast populations; the identification of mutations underlying convergent thermal adaptation, their verification using transgenic allele swaps; and integrated analyses predicting species ranges and climate change response by generating correlative and mechanistic models that include mutation availability, phenotypic plasticity, population size and growth.<br/><br/>This grant was cofunded by the Integrative Ecological Physiology Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Evolutionary Processes Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology, and The Rules of Life in the Division of Emerging Frontiers in Directorate for Biological Science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This gives rise to the many different types of cells. Over many years scientists have made progress in understanding how the packaging of genes into an open or closed formation determines whether the gene will be on or off. This is a fundamental part of biology. However, scientists still have very little understanding of what happens when these mechanisms go awry and different cell type programs are competing against one another. The microscopic worm C. elegans has a unique feature where every cell type is made exactly the same way in every embryo. This provides a unique opportunity to address this question. The Katz Lab will take advantage of the invariant embryo in these worms to learn the rules governing how cells respond when an incorrect program is activated alongside the normal program. This will address a fundamental aspect of biology with wide ranging implications for many different and important processes.<br/><br/><br/>Using C. elegans, the Katz Lab discovered that the H3K4me2 demethylase, LSD1, acts along with the H3K9 methyltransferase, MET-2, as an epigenetic reprogramming switch, replacing the active histone modification, H3K4me2, with the repressive modification,H3K9me2, at fertilization. In spr-5;met-2 mutants, the inappropriate inheritance of histone methylation leads to the ectopic expression of &#8764;200 critical germline genes in somatic cells, resulting in developmental delay. This model provides a unique opportunity to understand how inappropriately inherited chromatin affects transcription and how the expression of one developmental program affects cells trying to specify a different developmental program. To address this question, the Katz Lab will take advantage of the invariant C. elegans lineage to determine how chromatin, gene expression and cell fate are affected with single cell resolution in spr-5;met-2 mutants. This project is highly complementary to broader impacts pursued by the Katz Lab. Over the past 5 years of NSF funding, the Katz Lab at Emory University has partnered with a nearby liberal arts college, Oglethorpe University, to establish a Pipeline Course Embedded Undergraduate Research (CURE) curriculum, where biology majors take part in C. elegans research reiteratively throughout the biology major. This culminates in a Capstone Course, led by a postdoctoral fellow from the Katz Lab, where students spend the bulk of their class- time over a semester on an original C. elegans research project related to ongoing experiments in the Katz Lab. Because of the Pipeline CURE, the majority of biology majors now participate in authentic research, and initial surveys indicate that this authentic research can recapitulate the experience that is typically only found in an apprentice style approach at a major research university. To continue to lower the bar of accessibility to authentic research at a liberal arts college, the Katz Lab now proposes to provide every biology major the opportunity to conduct thesis research performed entirely in the classroom at Oglethorpe University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cilia move in regular, rhythmic patterns in order to transport materials outside the cells. These movements of the cilia are important at every stage of life, from early embryonic development to reproduction and regular healthy maintenance; in short, healthy cilia are a critical component of overall health of an organism. Consequently, when cilia move abnormally, numerous debilitating conditions can result, encompassing disorders ranging from developmental shortcomings in the embryo to adult pathologies such as infertility and lung scarring. Therefore, the key question this proposal seeks to answer is: by observing the motion of cilia, is it possible to predict whether the morphology or behavior is abnormal, and if so, whether that particular abnormality is associated with a specific condition? The answer to this question has implications not only in human health, but also in building fundamental knowledge of the biology around how cilia are constructed and maintained. To address this question, we are building the CiliaWeb platform, which will include new algorithms for analyzing videos of cilia and shedding light on the statistics of ciliary motion. The algorithms will take advantage of the regular back-and-forth movements of cilia and be built to incorporate crowdsourced feedback from users to improve the models of ciliary motion. As its name implies, CiliaWeb will be internet-accessible for researchers and clinicians to upload datasets, conduct analyses, and visualize results. The ultimate goal of CiliaWeb is to provide a standardized platform for ciliary motion analysis that can be reproduced and validated by others, encouraging collaboration and catalyzing new discoveries in fundamental cilia research as well as connections to health and well-being.<br/><br/><br/>Cilia are microscopic hairs that protrude from eukaryotic cells and are critical components in development, reproduction, and homeostasis. Cilia beat in synchronous waves to generate fluid flow and clear particulates; disruptions of these motions result in a spectrum of pathologies. However, no quantitative, reproducible, and validated method exists for assessing ciliary motion from high-speed videomicroscopy. Without such a method, beat pattern phenotype cannot be used to conclusively advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of cilia (construction and maintenance), nor the precise role of beat pattern in organismal health (examples being signaling, development, fertility). This proposal aims to create the CiliaWeb framework to establish an objective measure of motion phenotypes, enable new lines of inquiry into biophysical mechanisms of ciliary motion and discover the biological roles of specific motion phenotypes, as well as make possible cross-institutional collaborations, large-scale genotype-phenotype association studies, and longitudinal biomedical studies. The CiliaWeb platform will incorporate tightly-integrated and openly-available tools for processing ciliary motion, including: a novel unsupervised dynamic texture segmentation algorithm for automatically identifying cilia in high-speed digital videos; a hierarchical encoding scheme for quantifying ciliary motion at multiple spatiotemporal scales; a crowdsourcing module to solicit targeted feedback on the learned motion patterns that are fully interactive and automated. CiliaWeb will contribute methodological advancements in computational bioimaging and establish baseline data through the release of open source code and validated datasets, in addition to hands-on outreach and training for students in the form of workshops and hackathons.
