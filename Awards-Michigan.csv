The Center will enhance the development of applications of computational methods in biology, the use of artificial intelligence in computer science, and the enhancement of genetic algorithms in engineering design. Evolution by natural selection defines an algorithmic approach to finding solutions for complex problems; computer scientists and engineers have harnessed similar algorithms to a diversity of challenges that require optimization over multiple competing dimensions. Likewise, biologists have begun to employ digital modeling of the evolutionary process to examine evolution of complex biological structures and patterns in areas such as paleontology and the gene networks, which defy experimental manipulation in vivo. The Center will promote these interdisciplinary efforts by coordinating activities through three thrust groups: (1) Evolution of Genomes, Networks, and Evolvability, (2) Evolution of Behavior and Intelligence, and (3) Evolution of Communities and Collective Dynamics. <br/><br/>This center has the potential to transform both biology and computational sciences by developing digital experiments to test and apply fundamental principles of evolutionary biology. The possible impacts will be far reaching: from cyber-security to everyday computing applications, from the evolution of disease resistance to the self-organization of social behavior. The BEACON center will train the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists and educate the public about evolution and its role in solving real-world problems through significant educational outreach for K12 students and science museums."

The Multimodal Integrated Neural Technologies (MINT) hub aims to develop and provide tools that are able to read from and modulate neurons at multiple sites independently at high spatial and temporal resolutions. The hub will disseminate tools and methods to correlate the recorded cell activity with the structural connection. In this way, the connectivity of active cells can be visualized, labeled, and traced for detailed functional mapping. The mission of the MINT hub is to provide a collection of tools, synergistically developed, integrated, and available to the neuroscience community, to address one theme: connecting neurophysiology and structural analysis with a greater scale and resolution. The synergistic integration of these neurotechnology tools at the MINT Hub would accelerate the rate of discovery in neuroscience. This in turn can be expected to pave the way to improved treatments for neurological disorders and to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, especially neuromorphic computing. The MINT hub will provide annual training workshops for new users to be familiar with new technologies and able to use them effectively. To achieve sustainability, the hardware tools will be actively marketed to the community and those with sustainable volume will be transitioned to commercialization partners. Importantly, this program will cross-train neuroscience and technology personnel during the course of this program, resulting in preparation of a new generation of multi-disciplinary engineers and scientists.<br/><br/>This hub uniquely combines high-density electrodes, chemical sensing, optical stimulation, and cell labeling. Fiberless high-density optoelectrodes can allow optical stimulation of individual or few neurons with high specificity and selectivity using monolithically integrated micro-LEDs or optical waveguides on multi-shank silicon probes. Carbon microthreads will be used to create advanced arrays that will dramatically increase the ability to record from interconnected neurons and label those cells with high accuracy. Advanced metal alloys will also be used to greatly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of miniaturized electrodes. The MINT hub will innovate viral vector delivery and tissue clearing in the nervous system and combine these with multispectral labeling for intact cell phenotyping. Furthermore, an open-source software will be developed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of anatomical reconstruction for creating connectivity maps. The MINT hub will validate the developed tools and methods in three in-vivo experiments to exemplify what can be accomplished when the proposed modalities and methods are synergistically integrated. This NeuroTechnology Hub award is co-funded by the Division of Emerging Frontiers within the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental & Transport Systems within the Directorate for Engineering as part of the BRAIN Initiative and NSF's Understanding the Brain activities."

Some animals fail at apparently simple tasks, while others have a remarkable capacity to learn difficult tasks, recall complex information, and solve complex problems. It is suggested that animals need to be smart in order to manage relationships within social groups. Consistent with this idea, animals that live in complex social groups, like we see in humans, are typically smarter than non-social animals. Although comparing mental abilities across many types of animals has provided important information about the factors that influence animal intelligence, results from large comparative analyses are rarely definitive or easy to interpret. This project will take a new, experimental approach to understanding the causes and consequences of within species variation in animal intelligence. Using a wasp species where variation in memory and learning has already been found, individual and colony success will be compared to the ability of the colony members to learn and remember social contacts and experiences.  Findings from this work can help to better understand the impacts of social behavior on intelligence and provide a better understanding for why organisms, including humans, gravitate to social settings and groups.  Science education will be an important component of this project, including research opportunities for students as well as production of a comic book for middle school students that uses animal behavior research to teach students the scientific method.<br/><br/>The proposed work will use Polistes fuscatus wasps as a model to test the causes and consequences of variation in social intelligence. Despite decades of comparative work on the relationship between social behavior and intelligence, no previous studies have tested how and when selection acts on social intelligence. P. fuscatus provide a good model for this work because they use individual face recognition in daily interactions. Learning and remembering unique individuals allows the formation of individually differentiated social relationships, a challenging task that is thought to select for enhanced social intelligence. P. fuscatus also show extensive within-species variation in the ability to learn and remember unique conspecifics. The project has two main goals. 1) Test the factors that produce intraspecific variation in social intelligence, including the effects of social experience, nutrition, and genotype on cognitive variation.  Identifying how genotype and the environment interact to produce variation in social intelligence is important to understand how selection acts on this trait. 2)  Test the consequences of variation in social intelligence. Do individuals with enhanced social cognition benefit during social interactions relative to individuals with lesser social cognition?  This aim will provide the first intraspecific analysis of the selective consequences of social intelligence, testing a critical, untested prediction of the social intelligence hypothesis."

This virus is now threatening not only physical health, but also psychology, education, economy, and every corner of the infrastructure of society. So far, there is no treatment for this disease, while vaccines and neutralizing antibodies are perceived as one of the eventual solutions to this crisis. A critical piece of knowledge supporting vaccine and antibody development is understanding the genome of this virus. What is the common sequence shared among the SARS-CoV-2 strains across the globe? What are the subtypes? Are the genome variances overlapping with important genomic regions for vaccine design? Using state of the art machine learning approaches, this research will identify the shared, representative sequence across SARS-CoV-2 strains and group them by major types. This project will connect this information to the important genomic regions identified in the literature that can be used for vaccines, and thereby continuously inform the ongoing effort of vaccine development, antibody selection, and therapeutic development. The research from this study would provide society benefits through monthly updates onto web interfaces that allow the vaccine developers, the biomedical research community as well as the general public to conveniently get access to the above information. This project will support training of a graduate student in bioinformatics and provide outreach opportunities to K-12 students and the public.<br/><br/>This work will be a continuous effort to monthly subtype SARS-CoV-2 strains and update the shared sequences of SARS-CoV-2, in order to facilitate vaccine development and antibody design. Specifically, this research will be focusing on three objectives: 1) identifying and updating the common sequences of SARS-CoV-2 by forcing the common sequence to have the minimal evolutionary distance with all strains, or covering as many sequences as possible 2) subtyping the SARS-CoV-2 strains into major groups, which will be important to inform treatment, management and prevention measures; 3) connecting the subtyped and common genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to epitopes identified in the literature. To develop vaccines or neutralizing antibody treatment, it is critical that the major variations are covered and considered. The algorithms and visualization tools will overlay the curated list of potential epitopes on top of the subtypes and the shared sequence of the virus genomes, and directly support the effort of vaccine and antibody development.

This adaptation mechanism utilizes protein assemblies in the membrane to ""pump""  the toxins out, yet maintain the integrity of the impermeable membrane barrier that defines the cell. Such proteins undermine antibiotic treatment because they actively remove these drugs from the cell.  This project will investigate the evolution of antibiotic and antiseptic resistance in bacteria, focusing on a particular class of membrane proteins known as the ""small multidrug resistance transporters.""   This project will reveal fundamental knowledge that will inform the fight against drug-resistant bacteria. In addition, this research will elucidate how transport of select compounds across cell membranes evolved in nature. This knowledge will impact bioengineering strategies, with potential applications in biofuel production, bioremediation, and nutritional fortification of foods. This project will also provide training opportunities for undergraduates to learn cutting-edge scientific techniques. It will also include development of an augmented reality app that will engage undergraduate students and the general public in learning how molecular machines function and can be exploited in biotechnology.<br/><br/>The overarching scientific objective of this project is to gain insight into two key evolutionary events for membrane proteins: a) duplication of a progenitor single-domain protein to generate the two-domain architecture found in a plurality of transporters; and b) evolution of novel substrate specificity of such transporters.  The PI has recently identified and functionally surveyed a family of microbial membrane proteins that is an excellent model for both of these processes, the SMR (small, multidrug resistance) family, which comprises two subtypes: exporters of guanidinium ion, and exporters of bulky hydrophobic antimicrobials. Objective 1 will characterize, in atomic detail, the structure, mechanism and mutational robustness of representative SMR proteins that, because of their position in the phylogenetic tree, will be particularly informative for evolutionary analyses.  Objective 2 will test hypotheses about the evolutionary mechanism by which drug export function emerged in the SMR family.  To do this, we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining evolutionary techniques such as phylogenetics, ancestral reconstruction, and direct coupling analysis with membrane protein biochemistry, electrophysiology, and crystallographic approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Animal intelligence is composed largely of specialized abilities that respond to specific pressures in the environment. However, many recent discoveries suggest that non-specific, general intelligence, similar to IQ in humans, also evolves. Most hypotheses about the evolution of intelligence suggest that general intelligence evolves as a side effect of selection for more specialized cognitive abilities. In contrast, the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis suggests that general intelligence is directly favored by natural selection when animals are coping with novel environments. Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals today, and present them with many new cognitive challenges. This work tests predictions of the Cognitive Buffer Hypothesis by presenting wild spotted hyenas living in rural, urban, and transitional habitats in Africa with a battery of simple tests, much like IQ testing in humans. Performance on each specific task in the test battery will be compared among hyenas in the three habitat types, but a general intelligence measure will also be calculated from the individual test scores, and related to the strength of natural selection acting in each habitat. This work will permit determination of whether or not the strength of selection on general intelligence varies among ancestral, historically urban and rapidly-urbanizing environments. Broader impacts include international training of students, working closely with film crews to create television documentaries, and production of a children's book on hyena research.<br/><br/>The evolution of intelligence represents one of the greatest challenges in biology. Animal intelligence is composed largely of specialized abilities evolving in response to specific selection pressures, but recent work suggests that domain-general processes also evolve. The Cognitive Buffer hypothesis posits that general intelligence is favored directly by natural selection to help animals cope with novel environments. Urban environments are evolutionarily novel to most animals, presenting them with many new cognitive challenges. Here, predictions of the Cognitive Buffer hypothesis will be tested in the context of urbanization by presenting a test battery, focusing on seven elementary cognitive abilities, to 175 wild spotted hyenas occupying rural, urban, and transitional habitats in Africa. Performance on each specific task will be compared among the 3 habitat types, but a psychometric factor-analytical approach will also permit statistical derivation of a general intelligence measure, g, for individuals within each habitat type, and elucidation of the structure of hyena intelligence. Because data are available in each habitat on survival and reproduction, the strength of selection on g can be compared among the three different environments. Comparing selection gradients on g among habitat types permits assessment of the strength of directional selection acting on general intelligence in each environment.

These regulatory cognitive processes coordinate behavior so it aligns with current goals and is appropriate for a given context; for example, by turning off reflexive responses (such as reaching directly for a reward) and exerting self-control in service of long-term goals (such as planning for better rewards in the future). Why do some individuals exhibit more robust cognitive control than others? This project will develop novel experimental tasks, spanning multiple core components of cognitive control, to assess its emergence across species and over maturation. To do so, the project will leverage the strengths of several large, naturalistic populations where primates (here, chimpanzees, macaques, and lemurs) are semi-free-ranging but controlled cognitive experiments are also possible. By integrating data across multiple species, the project will examine when and why flexible forms of cognitive control emerge and test different proposed pathways that may promote cognitive control. Training, education, and outreach aimed at students from elementary school through graduate school will be integrated throughout the project. The project will develop an educational outreach program on primate cognition, behavior, and conservation for children, implemented in Michigan, Puerto Rico, and Uganda. Undergraduates will grain hands-on research experience through internships and course work integrating data science training, including through a new a summer internship program in primate cognition and behavior aimed at broadening student representation and access to the field. Finally, research teams will be led by postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, providing key international research experiences for trainees.<br/><br/>This project has three specific aims. The first aim is to identify unique aspects of cognitive control in humans and compare this with chimpanzees. There have been few standardized assessments of cognitive control in non-human primates. Here the research team will develop a battery of experimental tasks comprising key measures of working memory, inhibition, updating, performance monitoring, and planning to assess the structure of cognitive control in chimpanzees. The second aim is to test the hypothesis that the emergence of flexible cognition is linked to slow life histories with an extended period of juvenile development. The project will adapt the cognitive control battery to compare the ontogeny of cognitive control in chimpanzees (with slower life histories) and macaques (faster life histories). The third aim is to examine the general evolutionary pathways shaping the emergence of cognitive control by contrasting two major hypotheses about intelligence: the social intelligence hypothesis predicts that cognition evolves in response to complex social life, whereas the ecological intelligence hypothesis predicts that dietary ecology is more important. By comparing cognitive control capacities across eight closely-related lemur species that vary widely in natural history, the project will tease apart the relative contribution of social versus ecological complexity the emergence of intelligent, flexible behavior. This project will bridge evolutionary and developmental perspectives on cognition by leveraging the strengths of several naturalistic populations of chimpanzees, macaques, and lemurs varying in age. Together, this work will address the ultimate function and proximate mechanisms building robust executive control abilities across species.  This project is jointly funded by the Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Biological Anthropology Program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two examples are the many microbes associated with the human body (e.g., gut microbiome) and species that contribute to soil fertility and plant health. These natural microbial consortia that contain many different species, are often composed of poorly-characterized microbes. They also have complicated signaling networks of compounds and metabolites that are exchanged between community members. The complexity of natural consortia makes them difficult to study and can obscure identification of common principles that underlie many different communities. Consequently, many fundamental questions remain about how microbial consortia are organized to maintain productivity and resilience in the face of dynamic environmental conditions. This project makes use of artificial microbial communities that are relatively simple and composed of well-characterized microbes. These features of the artificial communities are chosen to facilitate an investigation that would lead to insight into underlying principles that guide the structure and function of microbial communities. The research activities increase knowledge of interaction dynamics in microbial communities, potentially improving the ability to engineer microbial consortia. The research also provides insight into the evolution of natural microbial symbioses. Through this project two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow are trained. In addition, there are multiple undergraduate research experience opportunities. The project also involves promoting the development of public forums for the discussion of potential benefits and ethical concerns of bioengineering. These forums are hosted in the Michigan Science Center in Detroit.<br/><br/>The research team is using a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942) that produces and secretes large quantities of sucrose from light and CO2. The PI has demonstrated that a variety of other microbes can be cultivated in the same media in a ""modular"" fashion. In these circumstances the co-cultured partner consumes the sucrose produced by the cyanobacteria. The flexibility in the design of these artificial microbial communities allows different heterotrophic bacteria to be cultivated with the cyanobacterium. In this way, common themes and mechanisms of interaction between the co-cultured species are identified. Approaches that include rational engineering, forward genetics, directed evolution, metabolic modeling, and individual-based simulations are used to identify the metabolites and signals exchanged between species. These approaches are also used to determine how metabolite exchanges contribute to consortia robustness. The knowledge gained is used to rationally design microbial communities that are more robust in the face of environmental pressures, such as invasion by ""non-cooperating"" microbial species. It is anticipated that the research efforts from this proposal will provide insights into fundamental interactions underpinning natural microbial symbioses, with translational impacts for the development of environmentally-sustainable cyanobacterial biotechnologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Defects in mitosis are thought to increase the chance of developing cancer. It is difficult to study the oscillator inside the cell, where many other complicated cellular processes are also occurring. This project will build a synthetic mitotic oscillator into tiny droplets to mimic real cells. Without the complicated effects from cell growth and cell divisions, these microdroplets enable quantitative manipulation and characterization of the mitotic oscillator. The knowledge gained through this research will be disseminated to the broader scientific community through publications, conferences, and workshops. The interdisciplinary technologies will be disseminated to youth and the public through proposed outreach activities such as demonstrations and lab open day in collaboration with local professional educators and the museum. These activities will allow us to engage underrepresented minority students in grades 6-9 interested in science, expose them to research excitement, and prepare them for STEM careers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to quantitatively analyze the stochastic dynamics of a minimal mitotic oscillator and its responses to various environmental signals. To constitute a minimal cytoplasmic mitotic oscillator, Xenopus egg cytosolic extracts will be encapsulated in microfluidic water-in-oil emulsions that mimic single cell behaviors. Additionally, a more complicated cell that contains nuclei will be built on top of this minimal oscillator. This will recapitulate complex phenomena in vitro such as nuclear assembly, chromatin condensation, and protein localization. Several questions will be examined in this system, including the role of cell size, temperature, and energy depletion in modulating properties of the oscillator.

They are composed of many types of lipids and are crowded with numerous transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins. These proteins participate in all vital cellular processes, including biogenesis, energy and signal transduction, molecular transport, vesicular trafficking, cell motility, recognition, adhesion, and shape regulation. Despite the growing number of atomic structures of membrane proteins, the lack of information about their spatial positions and protein-lipid interactions in their native membranes impedes our understanding of molecular mechanisms of their folding, stability, function, and regulation. Motivated by rising demands in realistic representation of proteins in non-planar and deformable membranes with natural lipid compositions, we propose a creation of a high-capacity cyberinfrastructure for fast and reproducible assembly of membrane proteins with natural lipids to build flexible multicomponent biomembranes for subsequent structural analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This project will promote synergy between scientific research and education by training computer science students in developing bioinformatics resources, by using the developed toolbox for teaching, and by providing training materials and web-based workshops for students and the user community to promote research experience in membrane simulations.<br/><br/>This collaborative project will enhance and combine capabilities of the highly recognized and widely used PPM/OPM and CHARMM-GUI resources that have been developed by the research teams from the University of Michigan and Lehigh University. The project has three main components. First, the PPM (Positioning of Proteins in Membranes) method will be advanced for calculating the spatial arrangement and binding energy of proteins in deformable membranes characterized by diverse polarity profiles, asymmetry, charge, and curvature. Second, a new PPM/CHARMM-GUI toolbox will be developed by integrating the improved PPM method and CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder to assemble native-like protein-lipid systems and provide input files for realistic simulations of biomembranes by various MD simulation packages. The open web-based platform will allow users of diverse expertise to easily setup and perform simulations of membrane proteins with known three-dimensional (3D) structures in deformable membranes with complex lipid composition. Third, native-like all-atom membrane systems for thousands of known membrane protein structures with natural lipids from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and organelles will be produced using this toolbox. The generated protein-lipid systems together with the inputs for MD simulations will be deposited in the improved and expanded OPM database (at opm.phar.umich.edu).

There has been much research to understand the evolution of morphological structures (e.g., shape, color, size). However, far less is known about the evolution of novel biochemical adaptations and the impact of these adaptations on the biodiversity of the organisms in which they appear. Of particular interest is how these traits arise if they are costly to the individuals who harbor them. This research investigates the evolution of biochemical adaptations and the genetic and ecological mechanisms that shape them. The research explores the tolerance of insects (fruit flies) to potent toxins in mushrooms that they consume. By investigating the mechanism of toxin tolerance and how this unique adaptation is maintained in this model system, the research will enhance the general understanding of how novel traits emerge and shape biodiversity. This project also includes activities designed to increase public scientific literacy and familiarity with biodiversity by training teachers and students, from middle school to the undergraduate level (particularly from underrepresented minorities), and generating photographic identification guides for insect species associated with mushrooms.<br/><br/>Flies from some groups of Drosophila feed on both toxic and non-toxic mushrooms, and can tolerate high doses of potent cyclopeptide mushroom toxins that are deadly to most other multi-cellular organisms. This research tests hypotheses that predict that: 1) tolerance to these toxic cyclopeptides evolved multiple times; 2) the genetic mechanism of tolerance is not the same in all species; and 3) trade-offs between the physiological costs of tolerance and the benefits of access to a low-competition resource maintain tolerance. The mechanisms of tolerance and their evolution within different fly species are being characterized using metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses that are analyzed in a phylogenetic framework. To assess the genetic basis of variation in toxin tolerance, the researchers are performing artificial selection experiments and genome sequencing. Finally, observational and competition experiments are being used to identify how selective pressures maintain toxin tolerance in natural populations. In sum, this research will provide an in-depth evolutionary, ecological, and physiological assessment of a costly and novel biochemical adaptation, and its impact on biodiversity."

Essential for controlling this information flow is both production and degradation of RNA, processes that are carried out by energy-utilizing polymerase protein machines and exosomes, respectively.  A third type of energy-utilizing RNA processing proteins are helicases, which are ubiquitous and modify the structure of RNA by unzipping RNA duplexes. An emerging theme is that RNA helicases are multi-functional machines playing additional roles beyond RNA unzipping, including energy requiring RNA anchoring and directly regulating the activity of other RNA processing proteins. The Ski2-like helicases are a new family of helicases, which act in close coordination with polymerases and the exosome to affect a broad range of RNA processing activities. These helicases have novel activity coupling RNA duplex sensing and motion. The project will investigate the fundamental molecular mechanisms of this novel activity to reveal how these diverse functions can arise from the accessory modification of core, conserved helicase components. The project will also investigate how these novel helicases cooperate and compete with other RNA processing proteins, e.g., a helicase and polymerase. The project will also leverage the optical tweezers developed and strong science outreach activities at MSU to expand an existing education and outreach program, which is based on hands-on interactions with biophysical science experiments at the levels of individual cells and RNA molecules both within and out of the lab. <br/><br/><br/>This project will investigate RNA-processing protein dynamics of single proteins and larger protein machine assemblies by developing and applying high-resolution, multi-modal single-molecule techniques. The project will specifically investigate the yeast Mtr4p helicase and the associated TRAMP helicase + polymerase system along with the related yet functionally distinct yeast DEAD-box helicase Ded1p. Mtr4p and TRAMP have emerged as key players in nuclear RNA surveillance and processing in part via precise modification of RNA for degradation by the exosome. While TRAMP is composed of only three proteins, two are opposing polarity molecular machines - the 3' to 5' Mtr4p helicase and the 5' to 3' Trf4p polymerase. Mtr4p performs multiple functions including unwinding RNA, discriminating substrates, and modulating polymerase activity to achieve precise poly(A) labeling of RNA. How these machines coordinate or compete to achieve function is controversial in large part due to their highly dynamic, multi-degree of freedom interactions on the scale of only 5-10 nucleotides of RNA. The project will be able to address the fundamental questions regarding how Mtr4p and TRAMP function using frontier single-molecule methods simultaneously combining high-resolution optical tweezers and fluorescence. The project will investigate: (1) How the recently discovered RNA-duplex-sensing translocation mechanism of Mtr4p is achieved via comparison to mutants, in particular one where the loss of a key domain dramatically alters activity, and to the related Ded1p helicase. (2) How the TRAMP polymerase activity is modulated in turn by Mtr4p via direct, simultaneous measurements of helicase and polymerase activity using fluorescence and tweezers. (3) How the related RNA helicase Ded1p unwinding mechanism occurs at the same mechanistic resolution as the Mtr4p studies. Advanced techniques combining high-resolution optical trapping and multi-color fluorescence will apply broadly across all biophysical molecular dynamics investigations towards the emerging need for tools to investigate protein-nucleic acid interactions beyond the individual molecule scale towards multi-protein, multi-degree of freedom complex systems.   The project provides strong science outreach activities at MSU to expand an existing education and outreach program, which is based on hands-on interactions with biophysical science experiments at the levels of individual cells and RNA molecules both within and out of the lab.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Most of our understanding of parental behavior comes from research on maternal care in mammals. As a result, we know very little about parental care in fathers, especially in cases where fathers alone care for offspring. Filling this gap is critical, as fathers vary in their expression of parental care, often with important consequences for their offspring. South American poison frogs show all three types of parental care: mother only, father only, and biparental care. These species therefore provide a unique opportunity to learn more about the causes and consequences of parental care. The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms driving variation in parenting behavior by investigating hormone levels, neural activity, and brain gene expression. This research will add to our understanding of male parental behavior and the origins of individuality in behavior. In addition to innovative research involving students from diverse backgrounds, the project will expand an existing outreach program to bring hands-on learning of a wide range of biological topics to K-12 students.<br/><br/>Using the Dendrobates tinctorius (poison frog) study system, the mechanisms underlying individual variation in paternal behavior will be investigated by combining data from multiple hierarchical levels of biological organization. The Fellow will characterize individual variation in parental care in fathers and link this behavioral variation to hormone levels at time intervals, neural activity across brain regions, and gene expression specifically in neurons active during parental care. The work will also include conducting hormone manipulations and the use of gene editing techniques to modulate gene expression. Taken together, the project will address fundamental questions about the mechanisms underlying parental behavior and how individual variation propagates across levels of biological organization, from genes to behavior. Through the project the Fellow will gain research, mentoring, and professional skills for an independent research career. The Fellow will also participate in collaborative projects to mentor undergraduates and community college students, as well as to expand hands-on learning opportunities to K-12 classrooms through the Froggers School Program.

However, cases exist in which the 50:50 sex ratio is distorted towards more male or more female offspring.  The basis for this distortion is not understood.  Evidence suggests that some of the genes on the X and Y chromosomes compete against each other in an ?evolutionary arms race? that leads to differences in the ability of X- versus Y-containing sperm to fertilize an egg.  This project aims to understand the molecular details of this competition, using mouse as the study organism.  Success will contribute to an exciting new field of sex chromosome biology by explaining the genetic basis for normal and distorted sex ratios in mammals.  Graduate and undergraduate students participating in this research will develop new experimental skills in mouse molecular genetics and computational skills in analyzing large DNA sequencing datasets. In combination with the research directions of this project, educational and outreach components will promote learning experiences in genetics and evolution. Graduate and post-doctoral researchers will provide continuing education to high school teachers, via a dedicated seminar series, and interactive engagement with high school students by participation in a state-wide Michigan DNA Day.  The general public will gain exposure to the research via an exhibit at the University of Michigan Natural History Museum.<br/><br/>Evolutionary theory posits that highly differentiated sex chromosomes provide an ideal battleground for genes to compete against each other.  Indeed, across animals, there are a few examples of X- and Y-linked genes in genetic conflict that distort the sex ratio.  However, the underlying molecular mechanisms governing how X- versus Y-linked gene competition drives sex ratio distortion remain unclear.  Recent studies have identified X-linked, newly acquired and massively amplified gene families present only in the mouse lineage that contributes to sex ratio distortion.  This X-linked gene family, called Slxl1, is considered to be in conflict with a related, co-amplified, Y-linked gene family, called Sly. Slxl1 versus Sly genetic conflict appears to be dose-dependent due to massive changes in gene dosage on the X and Y chromosome over the last 20 million years since mice diverged from rats. Using a combination of advanced mouse molecular genetics techniques and computational analyses, the project will address three important questions to learn how Slxl1 versus Sly genetic conflict contributes to sex ratio distortion.  1) Is Slxl1 gene expression level important for mediating sex ratio distortion? 2) Is communication between X- and Y-bearing haploid sperm cells necessary for Slxl1 and Sly to compete? 3) How might other massively duplicated, sex-linked genes influence Slxl1-dependent sex ratio distortion?  The results are expected to provide insights into a new model of dose-dependent genetic conflict and may reveal a common mechanism by which X- and Y-linked gene families distort the sex ratio.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many members of the mint family produce so-called secondary metabolites, which are by-products of plant chemistry that impart the familiar flavors of peppermint or spearmint in herbal teas or savory culinary seasoning from oregano, basil, lavender and other herbs. Human appreciation and consumption of these botanical compounds supports a growing agronomic industry, with the market for peppermint and spearmint oil alone worth over $200 million in 2011 (USDA); and yet how and why the underlying chemistry of these compounds evolved in the family is unknown. This project studies the chemical pathways required to synthesize flavor compounds using genome sequencing and by identifying all the relevant factors produced in each species. By comparing the resulting large datasets across family members, the project will clarify how such chemical processes evolved in plants. The interdisciplinary nature of the project requires the participation of experts in biochemistry, genomics, genetics and evolutionary biology. In turn, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students are trained at the frontiers of science by learning cutting edge genomics research that links directly to products of economic value. Through collaboration with the Michigan State University 4H Children's Garden and the Florida Museum of Natural History, the project offers informative displays and tours so the public can become citizen scientists as they learn about the evolution and underlying ""flavor"" chemistry of the familiar and much appreciated mint family. <br/><br/>The Lamiaceae represents a large family of angiosperms with a high degree of chemical diversity. The major subfamilies within the Lamiaceae, the Lamioideae and Nepetoideae, can be readily distinguished morphologically and also show qualitative and quantitative differences in the synthesis of two key specialized compounds, iridoids and volatile monoterpenoids. These compounds play an essential role in plant reproduction, defense, and signaling and are also the source of mint and other herbal flavors for human consumption. This project integrates genomic, metabolite, phylogenetic, and functional datasets to investigate the evolution of the monoterpene and iridoid biosynthetic pathways in the Lamiaceae. In the first phase, the transcriptomes and metabolomes of a phylogenetically diverse panel of 50 species will be generated and analyzed to identify a robust set of 14 species for focused study. In the second phase, full genome sequencing, expression, and metabolite levels will be conducted on the selected set, thus providing resources to (1) identify specific genes involved in monoterpene and iridoid biosynthesis, (2) elucidate key evolutionary events and mechanisms that led to the extant chemical diversity represented in the Lamiaceae, and (3) functionally test hypotheses about how variation in biosynthetic pathway genes contribute to chemical diversity. All resources from the project, including genome, transcriptome sequences and metabolite information will be publicly available through publications, the NCBI sequence archives, the Dryad Digital Repository and posted on a project website hosted at Michigan State University."

A prominent knowledge gap in disease epidemiology is an understanding of the factors that influence variation in infectiousness of individuals. This project has four main objectives: (1) Test how variation in host body condition, through food restriction, affects how a bird responds to West Nile virus, using American robin (Turdus migratorius) as a focal species. (2) Use genome-wide technologies to investigate how gene expression mediates variation in viral shedding using low pathogenic avian influenza virus and two species of waterfowl, the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and blue-winged teal (A. discors).

These trade-offs prevent individual biological species from dominating every habitat and climatic condition. However, while these trade-offs are prevalent, the understanding of what genetic and physiological mechanisms cause them is poor. Identifying the mechanisms underlying trade-offs in plants will provide knowledge of how evolution works and guidance for the improvement of crop species. This research focuses on understanding why trade-offs occur for adaptations of the yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus) to highly divergent coastal and inland climatic conditions in California. The coastal habitats of this region are inundated by a cool ocean fog during the summer months, which allows plants to survive year-round, but also means that there are more herbivores which eat them. In contrast, inland habitats are very hot and dry in the summer. The ways in which monkeyflowers have adapted to these different climates involves strong trade-offs, for which this research will establish the underlying mechanisms. The research will involve the mentorship of graduate students, postdocs, and underrepresented minority undergraduate students. Further, this award will support an ongoing partnership between investigators and the Michigan State University College of Education to create an inquiry-based learning module, focused on the monkeyflower system, for low-income middle school classrooms in Flint, MI. A website will be developed for distribution of this education module to classrooms nationwide. <br/><br/>Whether to allocate resources to reproduction, growth, and/or defense is a fundamental dilemma faced by all plant species. This research will focus on the evolutionary divergence in allocation to rapid reproduction, long-term growth, and herbivore resistance between coastal and inland M. guttatus. Inland populations allocate resources primarily to rapid growth and reproduction to escape from seasonal drought while investing little in herbivore resistance. Coastal populations have evolved to invest more in vegetative growth and herbivore resistance as a result of higher herbivore pressure and a longer growing season. Aim 1 of the research will evaluate how two previously identified loci (DIV1 and DIV2) involved in adaptive divergence between coastal and inland populations contribute to concentrations of precursor and bioactive forms of the Gibberellin (GA) growth hormone and the defense hormone Jasmonic Acid (JA). The effects of the two loci on induced and constitutive levels of defensive phenylpropanoid glycosides (PPGs) will be evaluated. Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive variation in allocation among rapid reproduction, long-term vegetative growth, and herbivore resistance. Functional molecular studies of gibberellin biosynthesis and signaling genes will be conducted to evaluate their role in the evolution of trade-offs. Aim 3 will use hormone applications in the field to evaluate the role of those hormones in adaptive shifts in resource allocation across climatic conditions. Plants will be grown in manipulative reciprocal transplant experiments to assess the roles of GA and JA pathways on flowering time, biomass, and fitness in coastal and inland habitats.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The novel platform will provide much greater sensitivity and specificity, in part by developing higher separation capacities than the commonly used mass spectrometry-based methodologies. The impact of these advances will be wide, as many areas of fundamental research in biology involve mass-limited protein analyses, such as developmental biology, cancer biology, and neuroscience. The project requires advances in both chemistry and biology, and through involvement in the research it will train a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students for careers in interdisciplinary research. Project personnel will host local high school students from under-represented groups as  participants in the project, nurturing their interest in science, prompting active learning experiences, and encouraging them to pursue science careers.<br/><br/><br/>Bottom-up proteomics is a powerful tool for large-scale and high-throughput characterization of proteins in the cell. Over 8000 protein identifications from human cells can be accomplished using advanced bottom-up proteomic methodologies, given hundreds of micrograms of protein material. However, to progress in using bottom-up proteomics for the analysis of mass-limited proteome samples, containing only low micrograms to nanograms of proteins, will require novel analytical tools with drastically better sensitivity. This project will develop an innovative and automated nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography-capillary zone electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (nanoRPLC-CZE-MS/MS) platform for highly sensitive and deep bottom-up proteomics. This transformative approach will boost the sensitivity of bottom-up proteomics by over two orders of magnitude, enabling the identification of about 8000 proteins from only nanograms of human cell protein material as proof of concept. The novel methodology will benefit a variety of scientific communities for pursuing answers to important fundamental questions that involve mass-limited proteome analyses. The research will also apply the nanoRPLC-CZE-MS/MS technology in discovering the changes in the level of abundance  of chromatin-associated proteins in zebrafish embryos during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). The MZT is key for development, and it coordinates important events during early embryogenesis, e.g., zygotic genome activation. The quantitative proteomic dataset will provide a better understanding of the roles played by chromatin-associated proteins in modulating the zygotic genome activation during the MZT.

While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.<br/><br/>This research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community."

Photorespira-tion is a plant process that recycles toxic products created as a byproduct of photosynthesis and is an essential process needed by the plant to grow. Rates of photorespiration are linked to growing tempera-ture and carbon dioxide concentration, meaning that future rates of photorespiration will change with changing climates. One carbon metabolism is similarly vital to plant growth, and also is the source for essential vitamins like folate. The goal of this project is to help generate models predicting how current and future climatic conditions influence plant performance and yields, and inform breeding and engineer-ing approaches to optimize plant productivity and the production of plant compounds important for human nutrition and health. During this interdisciplinary project, high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral trainees will be taught integrative approaches to plant biology, broadening their education and learning opportunities in collaborative scientific research. The aim is to instill positive attitudes towards science, and encourage creative and critical thinking by providing trainees with greater access to the sci-entific process early in their educational training. Participation of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students will be accomplished by taking part in several university programs designed to provide information on existing research opportunities to under-represented groups at Washington State Universi-ty and Michigan State University. The main public-facing outreach activity of this project is a Sounds of Science performance at Washington State University, a unique collaboration between plant scientists and musicians resulting in a TED-talk styled event aimed to increase awareness of the importance of plant science. <br/><br/>Traditionally, photorespiration has been considered well defined with little metabolic flexibility. However, the PI?s recent work suggests that photorespiratory flux can alternatively be partitioned into the metabo-lism of tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon (C1) units in the cytosol. This may provide an overflow for the traditional photorespiratory pathway and has important implications for the energetics and carbon balance of photorespiration, photosynthesis, and foliar nitrogen assimilation. Therefore, it is important to define the contribution of cytosolic C1 metabolism to photorespiration, particularly in response to conditions that influence rates of photorespiration (e.g. drought and high temperature). The goal of the project is to de-termine the role of cytosolic C1 metabolism in photorespiration. It is hypothesized that two cytosolic C1 enzymes, formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase and serine hydroxymethyltransferase, participate in processing of formate and serine generated during photorespiration. Reverse genetics, leaf gas exchange, metabo-lite analyses, and labeling-assisted metabolic flux analysis will be used to test the role of these two en-zymes in the coordination of carbon metabolism between the C1 and photorespiratory pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells tune the strength and specificity of responses by changing the number of receptors available on the surface, by transporting them to and from compartments inside the cell. Therefore, how receptor transport is regulated is a fundamental question that is critical to understanding how cells respond and adapt to their environment. This project addresses this question by integrating direct visualization of the dynamics of receptor movement in living cells in real time, quantitative modeling, and molecular genetics, to test a mechanistic model for how receptor transport is regulated and how this regulation influences cellular responses. Through its broader impacts, this project offers an opportunity to train undergraduate and graduate students in using microscopy to address mechanistic questions, and to iteratively integrate microscopy, quantitative data analysis, and modeling to address cell biological questions. Further, to reach a broader community and promote the use of quantitative imaging in education at an early stage, the PI will actively introduce the tools developed and the information obtained to both science-focused and general public forums, including among students and teachers in high schools with underrepresented minorities, and in lifelong learning centers, in the Pittsburgh area.<br/><br/>The endosome serves as the primary sorting station for proteins, including signaling receptors, that are internalized from the cell surface. Of the four main pathways taken by internalized receptors in the endosome, three - bulk recycling, degradation, and trafficking to the Golgi - have been extensively studied, and the mechanisms identified have each defined major new directions in cell biology. This project addresses the fourth and comparatively less studied pathway - sequence-dependent recycling. Many signaling receptors are restricted to this pathway, but how and why are not known. A major hurdle in studying this process has been the lack of direct assays to visualize and analyze receptor sorting in real time. Emerging data indicate that endosomal sorting relies on kinetic principles, further emphasizing this. Therefore, the research goals of this project are to develop and use quantitative live-cell imaging approaches to directly visualize the sorting of B2AR, a member of the largest family of signaling receptors, as a prototype for sequence-dependent recycling, and to integrate the data obtained into quantitative models to test a mechanistic hypothesis for receptor sorting. By using approaches from whole-cell to single-event imaging, the project will test the hypotheses that signaling receptors are actively restricted to sequence-dependent recycling by their interactions with the putative endosomal complex identified, and that these interactions serve as control points for signaling pathways to reprogram receptor trafficking and signaling. The educational goal of this project is to promote quantitative microscopy as a mechanistic tool and train graduate and undergraduate students in methods in quantitative cell biology."

Two epigenetic molecules, called UHRF1 and UHRF2, have distinct cellular functions, but are not well characterized at the molecular level. The proposed research seeks to determine the molecular differences by which UHRF1 and UHRF2 interact with epigenetic material. The project will establish a productive and collaborative research program that provides valuable scientific training for ~12-14 undergraduate students at Eastern Michigan University (EMU). Strong mentorship and cross-disciplinary training will provide students with critical thinking and research skills so they are prepared to succeed in future biomedical careers. The research plan will also be integrated into undergraduate biochemistry lab courses to give additional students the learning benefits of research. Together, the proposed work will strengthen the academic and research environment at EMU and increase basic knowledge in the area of epigenetics. <br/><br/>Histone reader proteins engage epigenetic modifications and play a central role in the regulation of many nuclear processes such as transcription, DNA replication and DNA repair. The detailed molecular mechanisms by which many of these proteins mediate histone recognition remain unknown; thus this represents a major gap in our current understanding of how these proteins impart specificity and regulate the epigenetic apparatus. This research focuses on the histone reader protein UHRF2, a close homolog of UHRF1 with distinct nuclear functions. While UHRF1-histone interactions are well studied, very little is known on the molecular and structural requirements of histone recognition by UHRF2. The goal of this project is to determine the molecular and structural mechanisms by which the histone binding domains of UHRF2 functionally interact with histone H3. Equilibrium binding assays, mutagenesis and crystallographic approaches will be utilized to elucidate the mechanisms that dictate histone-binding specificity between UHRF1 and UHRF2.

Under these circumstances, change is often not a choice. Cells inevitably find new ways to adapt and survive upon exposure to acute stress. Bacterial cells that are exposed to antibiotics acquire resistance through changes to their DNA sequence. Plants make decisions about their flowering times based on their time of exposure to cold conditions. Cancer cells, when exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, can become resistant, posing a significant challenge to treatment and worsening patient outcomes. In many cases, these adaptive changes are epigenetic - they result in gene expression changes without any alterations to the genetic blueprint. In contrast to genetic mutations, epigenetic changes can be transient, heritable and reversible providing diverse pathways for cellular innovation. The thousands of genes within the nucleus of each cell serve as tunable knobs that can alter cell fitness. We do not understand how cells choose which knobs to turn, and making the wrong choice could prove catastrophic. This NSF-funded research program aims to understand the fundamental rules that shape the inner workings of the cell. This research program captures the chaotic collisions between molecules within a cell which can work in unison to help cells make accurate, adaptive decisions. This project also seeks to broadly impact high school and undergraduate education in Michigan through a unique emphasis on interdisciplinary research and learning. <br/><br/>Understanding the fundamental rules of life that guide cells to make adaptive decisions requires interdisciplinary tools that capture cellular processes across different time and length scales. Because epigenetic changes can occur even without cell division and are not permanent, they lead to a rapid, reversible, and adaptive cellular response that has profound consequences for cell growth and survival. This research uses high-resolution imaging to visualize single molecules in cells, microfluidic platforms to reveal decision making events within individual cells, and automated continuous culture methods to investigate the dynamics of cell populations. The synthesis and integration of these multi-dimensional viewpoints will enable the development of mathematical models with the potential to predict emergent properties of these complex regulatory networks. Ultimately, the outcome of these studies will be a set of rules that define how adaptive epigenetic states, much like genetic mutations, represent evolvable traits in eukaryotic genomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As genome sequencing can help characterizing this diversity and has recently become routine, most microbial scientists have been overwhelmed by the amount of available data. For many researchers, a complete and thorough analysis of the available genome data is not necessary. Instead, these users would be better served with straightforward methods that can identify their unknown DNA/RNA sequence(s), and be able to discriminate between well-understood taxa and those that are potentially novel. Tools that can help direct researchers to the most ""interesting"" genomes and genes among thousands of candidates will be important. Furthermore, metagenomics, which is the sequencing of environmental DNA, allows the genetic characterization of the majority of these prokaryotes that have resisted cultivation in the laboratory. However, current tools to analyze metagenomic data are clearly lagging behind the development of sequencing technologies (and data processing tools), and are typically limited to genome assembly and gene annotation. This is a major limitation for better understanding, studying and communicating about the biodiversity of uncultivated microorganisms that run the life-sustaining biogeochemical cycles on the planet, form critical associations with their plant and animal hosts, or produce products of biotechnological value. Therefore, new approaches to make the emerging genomic and metagenomic sequence information readily available to the non-expert user are timely and essential in order to advance our understanding of the diversity and function of microbial communities across the fields of ecology, systematics, evolution, engineering, agriculture and medicine.<br/><br/>   The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computational framework to organize and catalogue the genomic and metagenomic information of the ""uncultivated majority"" of bacteria and archaea that will scale-up with the available and forthcoming metagenomic data sets. To achieve this goal, the Microbial Genomes Atlas project (MiGA), which was originally designed to catalogue the diversity among isolate genomes, will be used and expanded with new tools and computational solutions that will allow it to encompass the ""uncultivated majority"". The new tools include -but are not limited to- a kmer-based approach to replace the alignment-based genome-average nucleotide identity (ANI) metric for estimating genetic relatedness among genomes and high-throughput tools for assessing genome completeness and quality, the pangenome of a group of genomes, and the level of genetic variation within natural sequence-discrete populations. This research effort will address critical limitations of the current 16S rRNA gene-based approaches in cataloging microbial diversity (e.g., lack of resolution at the species level and below), and will provide highly needed tools for the online analysis of high throughput genomic and metagenomic data from uncultivated microorganisms. The project will also provide multifaceted learning experiences to both undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of microbiology, evolution, genomics, bioinformatics, and computational biology, a pivotal area of contemporary research and education.

What is an individual organism varies greatly. With bacteria, an individual consists of a single cell, while in mammals individuals might have trillions of cells, all coordinating different roles (blood, skin, and so forth) Some species, such as the honey bee, form highly coordinated colonies (with queens, foragers, guards, and so forth) that behave like an individual organism. The evolution of previously distinct entities (cells or insects) into new types of unified individuals (bodies or colonies) are challenging to study because  evolution occurs over long time scales. Instead, the researchers will use computer simulations in which they will manipulate environmental conditions to see how they promote or constrain the evolution of complex individuals. The researchers will also develop web-based software to let others easily explore these evolutionary transitions, with a goal of simplifying experimentation by fellow researchers, facilitating student learning, and promoting citizen science.<br/> <br/>This project will be divided into three conceptual stages: (1) Formation: Under what selective conditions do formerly solitary organisms unite to form a higher-level individual unit? (2) Differentiation: Once higher-level units have been formed, how do the preexisting traits of the lower-level individuals (such as phenotypic plasticity or environmental interactions) influence the evolution of division-of-labor strategies? (3) Complexification: How do different types of division-of-labor mechanisms facilitate the evolution of new, more complex features (such as developmental patterns or tightly-coordinated task performance)? The researchers will use an experimental-evolution approach with digital study organisms that operate in a 2D virtual world. Digital evolution systems allow the researchers to observe all genomes in a population, track all interactions, and record perfect phylogenies. Each digital cell has a fully-functional genetic program, theoretically capable of performing any algorithmic processes. Evolution in these systems frequently produce unexpected survival strategies with complex environmental and inter-cellular interactions, far beyond a traditional simulation. Probing the conditions that produce major transitions in an open-ended and transparent system will contribute to a deeper understanding of our natural origins, generate numerous hypotheses that can be tested concisely in laboratory experiments, and promote ideas for how computational algorithms can be produced that coordinate at a scale comparable to biological systems."

Emerging global issues, such as climate change, loss of biological diversity, land and water resource conservation, and sustainable agriculture, require more reliance on a workforce with training and expertise in biodiversity science. Four workshops will be conducted over a 4-year period to increase the number and diversity of undergraduate students interested in pursuing careers in biodiversity science (including collections science and organismal, evolutionary, ecological, and environmental biology). Student recruitment will target students from local community colleges, minority-serving institutions, and four-year colleges and universities. Professional societies will also be enlisted to recruit Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, African Americans, and Latino American students to participate in two-day workshops hosted by natural history museums. Undergraduate students participating in the workshops will be exposed to emerging careers and research opportunities by: (1) shadowing museum professionals to get hands-on experience in collections science; (2) learning about research and career opportunities from diverse graduate students and early career professionals pursuing careers in biodiversity science; and (3) getting practical advice and individualized mentoring to navigate their undergraduate experience and optimize their potential for graduate school and careers related to biological sciences, museum studies, and biodiversity collections. <br/><br/>Across a broad range of scientific disciplines, diversity in research scientists has provided new perspectives and ideas leading to novel solutions and increased productivity. This series of workshops will work to recruit, retain, and sustain a larger, more inclusive, and diverse, undergraduate population of students equipped to engage in creative solutions for emerging science questions. Workshop activities will introduce underrepresented populations of undergraduate students to natural history museums, biodiversity collections, and collections-based researchers as a means to inspire and educate them in opportunities and data rich resources in biodiversity science."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Ben Mansfeld is ""The Effects of Tomato Domestication on the Circadian Clock and its Interaction with Resistance to Phytophthora infestans"". The host institution for the fellowship is the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Rebecca Bart.<br/><br/>Tomato is the second most important vegetable crop in the world, the fruit of which is eaten fresh or consumed in several processed products such as soups and sauces. Tomatoes are rich with important vitamins, minerals as well as antioxidants with potential anti-cancer and other healthful capabilities. The origin of the tomato plant is in equatorial countries in South America. As such, over millions of years, tomato plants have evolved a biological clock adapted to the day length around the equator. However, as humans domesticated tomatoes over the last few thousand years, they also traveled with the seeds, breeding tomatoes to be more successful crop plants in high latitude regions. Through this process, the tomato biological clock was altered to fit the new long days in these regions of the planet. The process of altering a crop's biological clock through domestication is not unique to tomato and may be quite common; however, because of its important role in regulating how the plant protects itself from disease and insects, an altered biological clock may thus increase a plant's susceptibility to disease. This research aims to use tomato as a model to better understand how crop domestication affected the biological clock and how this, in turn, may have affected the plant's innate ability to defend itself from disease. The overarching societal goal for this research is to contribute to increased crop defenses at a basic level, helping growers reduce their inputs and produce cheaper, sustainable food for a growing population. Training though this project will also further the Fellow's skills in plant genetics, genomics and plant-pathogen interactions. Broader impacts include mentoring high school and undergraduate students interested in learning more about bioinformatics, plant disease and crop improvement.<br/><br/>This research will explore the hypothesis that alterations to the biological clock have affected cultivated tomato responses to infection, specifically by Phytophthora infestans, the pathogen that causes tomato and potato late blight. First, a collection of wild and domesticated tomato lines will be screened for their circadian rhythm traits, using an automatic camera system. A high-throughput bioassay will be then be used to screen if these lines show a different response to infection by P. infestans, at different times (a ""gated"" response). Transgenic tomato lines with altered clock rhythms will also be generated and screened to test the effects of mis-regulation of clock genes on the gated response to infection. The two lines showing strongest difference in gated response will be used in a 72-hour gene expression study, in which leaves will be inoculated with the pathogen at dawn and dusk and sampled every 4 hours for RNA sequencing. Weighted gene co-expression networks will then be used to compare the transcriptional responses of wild and domesticated tomato and identify hub genes at the center of network co-expression modules that differ between lines. Finally, to map loci contributing to differences in wild and domesticated tomato, a segregating population will be phenotyped and quantitative trait loci mapped using a bulk segregant approach. Candidate genes will be validated using CRISPR-based mutagenesis. All the data generated in this research will be made accessible through an online web application as well as through public repositories such as the NCBI's Short Read Archive (SRA), Dryad (https://datadryad.org), and the Sol Genomics Network (SGN; https://solgenomics.net).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators of this collaborative project will study this question in weakly electric fishes from Africa, known as mormyrids. The team has previously discovered a protein, encoded by the gene kcna7a that has undergone intense natural selection mormyrids, which allows mormyrids to produce extremely short electric signals called an electric organ discharge (EOD). Despite the strong selection on mormyrids for brief EOD pulses, the evolution of pulse duration varies dramatically across the more than 200 species of mormyrids, and long duration EOD pulses have evolved at least three times from short-duration EOD pulse ancestors. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that the long-duration EODs are the result of selection acting on amino acid substitutions in the kcna7a gene. In this project, the investigators will test this hypothesis by examining the biophysical properties of kcna7a in species that secondarily evolved long duration EODs, and conduct field-based behavioral studies to determine the selective factors that lead to the evolution of long duration EODs. This project will enhance infrastructure for research by adding data products, refined functionality, and tools to the broadly utilized EFISH Genomics Web Portal, promote teaching and learning by ongoing mentorship of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates associated and broaden participation by continuing the productive relationship with a network of institutional partners to recruit talented personnel from underrepresented groups, working with Huston-Tillotson University, a HBCU in Austin, TX.<br/><br/>A major goal of 21st century biology is to understand how changes at the molecular level result in phenotypic changes at the organismal level. Despite the growing progress in unraveling the ""molecular basis of phenotype"" in a wide variety of taxa, it is important to maintain the view that forces at higher levels of biological organization shape phenotypes from the ""top down"". In many systems, these factors are well known, but their precise connection to identified genetic variants is still poorly understood. In electric fish, the selective forces that influence electric phenotype are known, the loci that produce them are identified, the specific nucleotides within these loci that affect function are characterized, and these loci are known to be targets of selection on macroevolutionary scales. In Specific Aim 1, this project will: determine the biophysical basis of secondary evolution of long EOD pulses by sequencing kcna7a in species that secondarily evolved long duration EODs and their congeners with short duration EODs, measuring their biophysical properties, examining the role of specific sites using site-directed mutagenesis, and determining whether secondarily derived long-duration EODs evolved once or multiple times in parallel. In Specific Aim 2, the investigators will determine whether species that produce long duration EODs have long-duration APs and, and whether properties of kcna7a currents are sufficient to lengthen them, using a combination of electrophysiology and computational modeling. In Specific Aim 3, the investigators will determine the selective factors that lead to the evolution of long duration EODs using by performing field studies in Gabon West-Central Africa. A investigators will continue their efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in partnership with an HBCU.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Often the defense involves turning on, or activating, beneficial genes that help the plant survive the damage and then turning off, or repressing, those genes once the danger wanes.  This research seeks to understand the molecular details of how these genes transition from ""off"" to ""on"".  Knowledge of the detailed mechanism could be broadly important for agriculture by providing a foundation for genetic manipulation and development of crop plants optimized for defense and growth. This project will offer research training opportunities to guest international graduate students and undergraduates from from a local community college, thereby contributing to the preparation of the future scientific workforce. In addition, through participation in hands-on research experiences, high school teachers will improve their ability to communicate the scientific process and engage their students in meaningful science learning.   <br/><br/>This research is focused on the plant defense hormone jasmonate.  In healthy plants, jasmonate-responsive genes are bound by a multi-protein complex composed of a repressor called JAZ, a transcriptional activator called MYC, and a group of other proteins.  In the absence of jasmonate, the JAZ repressor inhibits the MYC activator, and the genes are transcriptionally silent, or off.  In response to damage from herbivorous insects and many microbial pathogens, jasmonate is produced and turns on these genes by inducing the proteasomal degradation of the JAZ repressor, thereby relieving inhibition of MYC, which turns on the genes by activating transcription.  The molecular details and the roles played by the many proteins that participate in this transition from repressed to active state are largely unknown.  This project seeks to discover how the large multi-protein complexes involved in jasmonate signaling are assembled and regulated.  Approaches will include a combination of X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, biochemical, biophysical, and in planta analyses, and in cell signaling reconstitution. Because many signaling cascades result in transitions from repressed to active gene expression, the results could serve as a paradigm for discovering, and eventually manipulating, the responsible regulatory protein complexes. <br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Genetic Mechanisms and the Molecular Biophysics Programs in the Division of Molecular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investment to collect, develop, and distribute data and tools to further large-scale and long-term science is exemplified by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and Data Observation Network for Earth (DataONE) initiatives. These, and similar initiatives, represent a paradigm shift in the way future scientific discovery will occur. This Career award will develop theoretical, methodological, software, and instructional advancements that will allow current and future scientists and educators to draw valid inference about large and complex ecological systems by: assimilating disparate sources and types of data; accommodating spatial and temporal dependence to satisfy statistical model assumptions and improve predictive inference; partitioning and propagating sources of uncertainty through fine spatial scale predictions over large domains, and; scaling to effectively exploit information in massive datasets. The research will develop new flexible spatio-temporal modeling frameworks tailored to enable assessment of NEON's Grand Challenges in the areas of climate change, land use, invasive species, biogeochemistry, biodiversity, ecohydrology, and infectious diseases. Although development of the proposed methods is motivated by substantive questions related to NEON's mission, potential advancements in spatio-temporal data modeling will find use in fields such as public and environmental health, meteorology, engineering, and geosciences where the fundamental goal is the same -- use new findings to help improve society.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed educational objectives will enable students to explore their particular research interests, exploit complex data to build new understanding, and learn to collaborate to address challenges and opportunities within and across their respective disciplines. The award will develop and deliver several integrative education activities including: i) the development and implementation of cross-college undergraduate and graduate degree programs in Geo- and Eco-Informatics; ii) an undergraduate senior-level course in applied environmental data modeling; iii) a graduate-level course focused on more advanced topics in hierarchical Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling; iv) enrichment of science instruction in 23 K-12 schools in 13 districts in southwestern Michigan, and; v) graduate research symposia focused on contemporary topics in environmental data analysis that will engage students and experts from multiple institutions and serve as an opportunity for the graduates to share their research, network, garner specialized skills, and learn about NEON data products.

All living organisms contain DNA, the genetic material that serves as the blueprint for life. DNA from diverse organisms, such as bacteria and humans, has chemical modifications that affect how the encoded information is read. One such modification is methyladenosine.  Methyladenosine is commonly found in bacterial DNA and can change how cells process information by altering the genes that are switched on, which in turn can help the cell respond to changes in nutrient availability. This research examines a previously unstudied protein that forms methyladenosine in bacteria. When this protein is inactive and adenosine methylation is lost, cells undergo substantial changes in gene activity that affect how the cells develop and behave. This research benefits society by determining how methyladenosine influences bacterial development, including the formation of multicellular bacterial structures and distinct cell types that can affect antibiotic resistance. In addition to the research benefits, further societal impacts of this project include teaching the expanding field of computational biology to students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. The project's outreach initiative provides high school students in rural Northern Michigan with the opportunity to learn introductory bioinformatics using an online educational portal developed as part of this research. Further, this project provides training opportunities for the next generation of scientists at both the undergraduate and graduate levels with specialized training in cutting edge sequencing approaches and methods of data analysis. <br/><br/>The genomes of organisms from all three domains of life are known to harbor chemical modifications in the form of DNA methylation. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a type of modification detected in prokaryotic and some eukaryotic genomes. Although m6A methyltransferases, the enzymes responsible for genomic m6A, are found in many diverse bacterial species the function of m6A remains largely unstudied. The goal of this project is to understand the effects of genomic m6A modifications in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis. Initial experiments have shown that elimination of m6A from the B. subtilis genome results in the expression of genes involved in bacterial developmental processes. Moving forward, this research project will investigate the mechanism by which m6A affects the expression of genes involved in bacterial cell developmental transitions. Global genomics approaches will be used to determine the differences in bacterial chromosome structure, genome-wide protein landscapes, and gene expression upon loss of m6A. Further, targeted biochemical approaches will be used to determine if m6A is necessary and sufficient for differential gene expression and to identify the factors that respond to m6A in DNA regulatory regions. Once complete, this project will provide a mechanistic understanding for how m6A-dependent changes in gene expression interface with bacterial developmental platforms."

These shape changes are powered by the outer layer of the cell, which is called the ""cortex"".  The cortex contains a meshwork of fibrous proteins that can contract, protrude, and slide.  These movements provide the basis of cell shape changes.  The control of this fibrous network is the domain of a protein called Rho.  Rho is somehow activated in distinct patterns, each of which corresponds to a different cell shape change.  Thus, in order to understand and control processes such as cell division, cell migration and wound healing, it is essential to learn how to understand and control patterns of Rho activation.  In this collaborative project, investigators from the US and the UK use synthetic cell biology and mathematical modeling to test mechanisms underlying cortical pattern formation.  This project will provide research opportunities for interdisciplinary training at the interface between quantitative cell biology and mathematical modeling for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs.  The project also offers embedded research opportunities for high-school teachers as well as topic-specific K-12 and public outreach activities. <br/><br/>Previous studies by the PIs demonstrated that cells can support sustained waves of dynamically-coupled Rho activity and actin assembly, and mathematical modeling followed by experimental verification revealed that cortical wave propagation is based on Rho autoactivation and actin-mediated Rho inactivation.  This constitutes the basis of an ""excitable"" system, a family of well-established theoretical models with few previously-known cellular manifestations.  This project will deduce and experimentally validate a minimal molecular mechanism and basic design elements required for cortical excitability.  To achieve the goals of this project, a novel semi-synthetic platform for replicating complex cell behaviors using simple macromolecular parts will be employed, enabling manipulation of the molecular network at escalating complexity instead of by dissecting a complex physiological network.  The project will couple computational modeling of excitable dynamics to live-cell imaging in whole cells and in a new ex vivo model of cortical dynamics.  First, excitable dynamics will be reconstituted in resting, non-mitotic cells (oocytes of frogs and echinoderms) using natural regulators and their mutants, followed by their replacement with synthetic equivalents.  Second, a quantifiable ex vivo model will be developed (using frog oocyte or egg extracts and supported lipid bilayers) that permits precise control of system composition in a simplified context.  Third, to achieve on-demand control of cortical pattern formation, an optogenetic approach in animal oocytes will be used to explore the repertoire of both natural and synthetic cortical pattern formation.  Iterative experimentation and computational modeling will be employed throughout the project to 1) interpret biological data, 2) express candidate mechanisms in the form of mathematical models, 3) generate predictions, and 4) test those predictions experimentally."

However, human activities have compromised conservation goals in many nature reserves, and climate change poses additional threats to their long-term viability and success. Although some studies have analyzed climate change impacts on the conservation effectiveness of nature reserves, most have focused on individual nature reserves in localized regions.  Funding is provided to assess the changes in species distribution within and across networks of nature reserves in broad geographic regions, and to analyze the effects of climate change on the long-term survival of plant and animal species. An exceptional setting for achieving the objectives is the globally important forested macrosystem that is the historical geographic range of the world-famous endangered giant panda (2.2 million km2 across 19 provinces of China). Across this vast macrosystem there are currently 63 panda reserves and over 1,000 reserves for other purposes, which together constitute a reserve meta-network (network of networks).  Using state-of-the-art climate change projections, remote sensing techniques, meta-uncertainty analyses, and species distribution models, a multi-disciplinary and international team of researchers will analyze climate change impacts on conservation effectiveness of this meta-network of reserves as well as current and future geographic distribution of the panda and around 30 bamboo species that comprise 99% of its diet. <br/><br/>This project will lead to transformative and significant outcomes, such as testing and extending two fundamental theories (niche theory and connectivity theory) at macroscales.  It will also generate powerful and lasting broader impacts. Through active engagement with stakeholders, the research team will use project results to develop and evaluate effective and efficient conservation strategies of global importance in the context of climate change. Improving conservation strategies for a well-known charismatic endangered species will help to increase the public awareness of the potential climate change impacts on biodiversity, and encourage public engagement on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Through strategic communication and hands-on workshops, the results and methods will be widely disseminated to inspire others to analyze the impacts of climate change on other species and other nature reserve networks around the world.  Furthermore, the project will train undergraduate and graduate students as well as post-doctoral scholars, who will gain broad and deep knowledge and learn important skills to become future visionary leaders and globally-engaged researchers who can creatively address future challenges to biodiversity research and conservation."

Harsh environments such as cold weather or inadequate food can cause animals to slow their growth or even pause growth altogether.  Despite this severe interruption to their development, if the environment improves, animals will continue their growth and ultimately become normal adults.  The genes and proteins that allow animals to develop normally after a long interruption are unknown and are a major knowledge gap.  This project builds on previous work from the PI to study this question in the microscopic nematode C. elegans.  These worms are a valuable model because of their simplicity and ease of use for experiments.  Furthermore, C. elegans shares 7,663 genes with humans, meaning that what we learn from C. elegans is often relevant across species.  As part of this study, a new program will engage student teachers in research.  This program will foster teacher-leaders who will then provide effective STEM education at the K-12 level.  This education is critical for the US to maintain its leadership in scientific disciplines, and to provide students with skills that employers value.  Furthermore, this study will result in the training of many undergraduate and graduate students, both in the PI's research lab and in lab-based courses taught by the PI.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The proposed work capitalizes on the power of C. elegans as a model to elucidate mechanisms that enable development to occur normally after diapause.  In favorable environments, C. elegans develops continuously through four larval stages separated by molts.  In contrast, adverse environments promote entry into diapause (""dauer"") midway through larval development.  Despite this interruption, if favorable conditions are again encountered, development proceeds normally due to the modulation of developmental pathways and re-setting of cell fate.  Prior work from the PI indicates that the potentiation of microRNA activity is a key component of the post-dauer developmental program.  This project builds on that work to discover and characterize factors involved in post-dauer microRNA pathways.  Preliminary data suggest that two transcription factors, ZTF-16 and FOXO/DAF-16, are important players in the post-dauer pathway. Genetic and molecular experiments will test the hypotheses that ZTF-16 is a microRNA target and that FOXO/DAF-16 is a modulator of microRNA activity.  In addition, genomic approaches will identify factors that enable proper post-dauer development.  Completing this project will define mechanisms by which microRNA pathways that control cell fate are modulated after dauer and lay the foundation for future work."

Some of these specialized metabolites have well established roles, including protection from diseases and insects and attraction of beneficial partner organisms. Some are used by humans as medicines and environmentally safe pesticides. The metabolic pathways for only a small fraction of these compounds are well understood, leaving much to learn about how plants produce this enormous diversity of products. This research will focus on specialized metabolism in the Solanaceae (nightshade) family, which includes the important crops tomato, potato, peppers and eggplant and in which a great diversity of natural products is documented. The overarching goal is to develop computational and experimental approaches to discover new plant chemicals and to find the genes that plants use to make small molecules that are valuable for agriculture and human wellbeing. The project outcomes will expand the understanding of the biochemical and genetic mechanisms by which plants produce different classes of specialized metabolites. This research will support breeding and transgenic approaches to improve specialized metabolite synthesis in crop plants to increase resistance to disease and insects and enhance crop value; it will also develop new methods for combining computational and experimental approaches in the study of metabolism. The project outreach activities include summer research for undergraduates from under-represented groups, training of faculty for primarily undergraduate institutions with substantial minority enrollments, and a summer program for science outreach to adults.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: Technical abstract<br/><br/>The identification of genes involved in specialized metabolism is of great importance, since changes in these genes provide a basis for lineage-specific chemical diversity. This project will provide quantitative assessments of the differences between specialized metabolism genes and other genes. The predicted portion of the genome devoted to specialized metabolism within the Solanaceae will be tested using hypothesis-driven experimental approaches. This analysis of the Solanaceae family, which includes important crops as well as models in plant ecology and evolution, will establish a paradigm for computationally predicting and experimentally validating specialized metabolism-related genes across the plant kingdom. The project will take advantage of the rapidly increasing plant genome and transcriptome resources in the Solanaceae to define computationally the characteristics of genes encoding specialized metabolic enzymes. The computational approaches will be coupled with analytical chemical methods, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to discover specialized metabolites and to guide the identification of candidate genes encoding enzymes that produce novel metabolites. In vitro protein biochemistry and functional genomics methods will be employed to validate gene candidate functions, and to improve the accuracy of the computational methods.

Among these include processes that are not only associated with the immune system, but those also required for growth, development, reproduction and senescence. In this regard, plant immunity is not a narrowly defined process, but rather, a broader, integrated mechanism that uses the entire cell (and organism) to respond to pathogen infection. This research will ultimately define how plant stress signals are recognized, decoded, translated, and communicated to the whole plant. From this, insight into how signals from the outside are perceived and lead to the generation of genetically-encoded responses, internally, will be gained. The project employs a combination of microscopy-based techniques and biochemistry to uncover the signals that plants use to defend against pathogen infection. With this knowledge, the investigators will learn how plants determine if a signal is from a friend or a foe, and from this, determine how plants regulate the immune system. The ultimate goal of this research is to uncover the mechanisms that plants use to survive in environments where the threat of pathogen infection is high, and moreover, when environmental conditions favor the pathogen. The research team will also actively communicate to the public the link between basic research and agriculture. To do this, the scientists working on this project, including experts in heath and nutrition at Michigan State University will partner with the Lansing Capital Area library system to will educate young children ? and their families ? on topics related to food production and nutrition.<br/><br/>As a key component of the surveillance function of the immune system of both plants and animals, the actin cytoskeleton is required for cellular response to a variety of pathogen-derived elicitors. Additionally, a role for actin is emerging which includes the coordinated regulation of cellular processes that signal host defense, resistance, susceptibility, and cell death. While conclusive evidence demonstrating that the plant cytoskeleton directly interacts with individual immune receptors is lacking, an abundance of data in mammalian systems does exist; this includes a role for the pathogen-recognition receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein 1 (NOD1), which requires F-actin for proper PM localization. Further, the interaction(s) between NOD1 and actin serves as an immune interface which influences actin-remodeling and control of downstream signaling, including the phospho-dependent activation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin. This project will define the relationships that link the first line of plant defense (pattern-triggered immunity) to a complex and pervasive macromolecular structure ? the cytoskeleton ? to drive surveillance. The proposed research will contribute new insights in cell signaling across eukaryotic systems through the characterization and definition of the poorly understood mechanism by which cell structure and orchestration of pathogen recognition regulates signaling and immunity in plants. High school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students will be involved in the proposed work, and engage in cross-disciplinary training in the biological sciences utilizing traditional and contemporary methods necessary for success in modern biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even with knowledge of the properties of each individual component, these interactions create a challenge for predicting how changing one enzyme will affect the performance of the whole pathway and the growth of the organism. While synthetic biology has the potential to address certain critical national challenges, progress is hampered by a lack of mathematical models that can be used to guide the optimization of complex biological systems. This project works to optimize the mechanisms that incorporate carbon gas into cell material in order to develop an efficient organism for generating products such as fuels or pigments. The results of the experiments will then yield a computational model capable of predicting the effects of novel combinations of genes. This project will directly lead to specific improvements in an important biotechnological platform, while simultaneously demonstrating a generic approach to using computational biology to efficiently apply the power of genome editing to a variety of synthetic biology challenges. The project also will develop and disseminate computational tools via websites, publications, workshops, and classes that will make it easier for students and researchers to simulate and analyze metabolic networks to learn about fundamental quantitative concepts that underlie their function, and provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.   <br/><br/>Epistasis represents a critical challenge to optimizing biological systems. When mutational effects upon growth or product generation depend on the genetic background, assessing performance across the entire parameter space of any system of realistic size quickly becomes impossible. There is an immediate need for two linked developments: empirical techniques that can rapidly generate and assess rational, combinatorial variants, and kinetic modeling techniques to incorporate these data and to make predictions. This project will use this novel approach to optimize the function of the high-efficiency ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway that the team has successfully introduced into the model methanol-consuming organism, Methylobacterium extorquens. In this project, gene editing of a plasmid-encoded suite of enzymes will be performed along with deep sequencing to rapidly assess the fitnesses of a quarter-million genotypes with combinatorial variation in nine dimensions of expression.  The resulting epistasis data, combined with direct measurement of intracellular metabolite concentrations for select variant combinations, will be used to infer the numerous parameter values in the kinetic model, which then will be utilized to predict which regions of parameter space would be more or less flexible.  These parameter spaces will be targeted and compared in a second round of editing, experimentation and evaluation. <br/><br/>This project is funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences."

By combining approaches similar to those used in the Human Genome project, the researchers will identify alleles, special variations in these ""vitamin"" genes, and learn how to put them together to generate high amounts of vitamins in corn kernels.  An important outcome of this research will be the knowledge by which to enhance these micronutrient levels in corn kernels such that diets in which maize is a major component provide a balanced nutritional content. Such direct translation of these findings will be the eventual incorporation and fixation of identified alleles in maize breeding programs that are favorable for the increased levels of vitamins E and B to enhance the food and feed supply chain. In addition, this research will provide guiding principles for parallel efforts in other agricultural crops and thus enable predictive breeding and metabolic engineering of more nutritious crops worldwide.

This project brings together a team of scientists with divergent but complementary knowledge and skills that together will allow the genes, alleles and underlying mechanisms controlling these nutritional traits to be elucidated and the knowledge deployed on a global scale. Specific objectives are to (i) perform genome-wide association studies with the maize Ames inbred line panel (n~2,000) to identify and resolve quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling accumulation of these micronutrients; (ii) assess the role of rare alleles by constructing and analyzing segregating F2 populations derived from Ames lines that are extreme outliers for traits; (iii) determine the contribution of expression QTL and presence-absence variants (PAVs) to vitamin composition using whole transcriptome sequencing data obtained from grain 24 days after pollination in 500 inbred lines that represents the phenotypic variation of the Ames panel; and, (iv) perform genomic prediction with the Ames panel to accelerate the efficiency of breeding improved grain micronutrient composition in developing countries. The broader impacts of this project to the broader scientific community and public will be ensured through a set of coordinated activities that engage students, postdoctoral associates, scientists and the public.

For example, microbes can be used to treat wastewater and improve agricultural soil productivity. Understanding how microbes organize and persist in different environments is important for promoting beneficial outcomes, as well as mitigating harmful effects.  This project will focus on an amazing ability microbes have for surviving in changing environments--through a process called  phenotypic diversity--which enables them to produce progeny with a wide range of behaviors or characteristics.  Predicting phenotypic diversity behaviors in microbes is a major unsolved problem.  This project will use the environmental bacterium and human pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, to investigate the mechanisms used by bacteria to generate phenotypic diversity.  The fundamental principles learned from this project will be directly relevant to other microorganisms, thus, facilitating the management and engineering of microbes for beneficial outcomes. In addition, this project will provide research training for undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups. New knowledge will be shared with a broad audience through collaborations with secondary science educators and Impression 5, a science museum in Lansing, MI.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the role of the second messenger bis-(3-5)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) in controlling phenotypic diversity in clonal populations of Vibrio cholerae. c-di-GMP integrates environmental signals through a sophisticated signaling network to control, among other factors, the transition between motile and biofilm lifestyles. The hypothesis is that c-di-GMP signaling changes the sensitivity of transcriptional regulation to stochastic fluctuations inherent to molecular processes to control the proportions of different phenotypes. This project will use a combination of mathematical modeling, quantitative microscopy, and behavioral tracking to quantify the regulation of phenotypic diversity under different experimental conditions. Cell tracking and epifluorescence microscopy will be used to correlate signaling activity with behavior directly in single cells. The transition rates between motile and biofilm-forming phenotypes in growing cells will be quantified using time-lapse experiments. Finally, a genetic approach will be used to manipulate c-di-GMP levels and transcription regulation to test specific predictions from theoretical models. Overall, this project will elucidate design principles that allow signaling networks to integrate stochastic fluctuations with environmental signals to generate and control advantageous phenotypic diversity in clonal populations."

While some studies have separately examined socio-environmental interactions between adjacent or distant systems, they usually focused on one-way impacts. Although these separate studies have generated useful information, little is known about the relationships among socio-environmental interactions within and across adjacent and distant systems systematically and simultaneously. This award will fill these key knowledge gaps by addressing some of the world's biggest challenges such as land use and food security across scales and across borders. The results are expected to reveal transformational insights into global food production, trade, and labor dynamics. They can also shine light on the potential cascading consequences of land use decisions. This innovative research represents an exciting new frontier, with pioneering contributions to the theory, methods, and applications of socio-environmental systems research. It will be tightly integrated with ambitious education and outreach efforts, elevating the public's understanding of the socioeconomic and environmental effects of complex trade relationships. Students and postdoc will gain broad knowledge and learn important skills to become future visionary leaders and globally engaged scholars.<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary research team will apply and quantify the holistic metacoupling framework that integrates socioeconomic-environmental interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant systems. Fundamental questions include: How do intracouplings (e.g., food production within a coupled system), pericouplings (e.g., labor movement between adjacent systems), and telecouplings (e.g., trade between distant systems) complement, enhance and/or offset their effects on socio-environmental feedbacks? To address this and other questions, the project will leverage existing and new data on global trade of a major agricultural commodity -- soybeans -- and associated labor and financial flows for commodity production. Analyses at the international/national scales will be conducted with new global grid-based models and other state-of-the-art tools. They will be complemented by in-depth studies at regional/local scales in key soybean exporting and importing countries through population census and agricultural data, ecological fieldwork and face-to-face interviews to inform the development and validation of a novel metacoupled agent-based model. These studies, spanning local to international scales, will be joined via systems integration. The international researchers will understand and simulate complex dynamics and feedbacks of metacoupled systems under various scenarios co-designed with stakeholders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some symbioses, each partner improves the well-being of the other partner. For example, some bacteria that reside in the human gut provide a benefit to humans through vitamin production, keeping out harmful bacteria, or fortifying the immune system. In turn, humans provide gut bacteria with a place to live and food. Animal-bacterial symbioses are fascinating not only because they are widespread and seem to play critical roles in human biology, but also because these relationships generate tremendous complexity at the molecular level. Each partner must recognize, and then continue to tolerate, a specific associate. How is this delicate balancing act of specificity and tolerance achieved? This award will study the mechanism of this symbiotic balancing act in a model symbiosis, between a nematode (roundworm) and bacteria. To better understand specificity in this symbiosis, researchers will use microscopy and genetics to identify relevant molecules and mechanisms. To better understand tolerance in this system, they will define genes that generate an appropriate response to the partner. Overall, by studying mechanisms that govern specificity and tolerance in a specific symbiosis, the work will generate testable hypotheses for how animal/bacterial relationships are regulated more generally. Finally, because the award funds research at an undergraduate-only institution, it will positively impact many young scientists. They will learn experimental techniques, data analysis and strategies for communicating their results to the public via an online writing program. <br/><br/>This award studies partner specificity and tolerance mechanisms in the model symbiosis between Heterorhabditis nematodes and Photorhabdus bacteria. Together, these partners infect and kill insect larvae; the nematode serves as a delivery vector while the bacteria produce insecticides and antibiotics. The symbiosis is very specific. Not every Photorhabdus strain can colonize every Heterorhabditis strain. It is also a remarkable example of tolerance. Photorhabdus is a powerful pathogen, capable of killing not only insects but also multiple genera of nematodes while sparing its Heterorhabditis host. At different stages of the nematode life cycle, the bacterial symbiont either stably colonizes, or is digested by, the nematode. The award will determine how specificity and tolerance of the Hetorhabditis/Photorhabdus symbiosis are achieved at a molecular level. Specifically, it will test the hypothesis that genetically encoded regulatory mechanisms, in both symbiont and host, shape the symbiosis at two levels: (1) over evolutionary time - determining which specific relationships endure; (2) over a single host's lifespan - maintaining tolerance without compromising self-defense. The proposed research will identify specificity and tolerance mechanisms in both host and symbiont, using microscopy, forward genetics, gene expression analysis, and nematode lifespan/fitness assays. Projected outcomes include enhanced understanding of regulatory mechanisms in this system and expanded knowledge of nematode-bacterial interactions in general. Furthermore, this work has the potential to improve understanding of how symbiotic/antagonistic relationships evolve and persist. The awards enhances scientific education at an undergraduate institution and promotes both research and scientific communication skills of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
