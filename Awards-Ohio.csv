Exceptional navigation is not limited to animals with large brains, like birds and mammals. It can also be found in animals with simpler nervous systems. The tropical amblypygid, a scorpion-like animal, is able to find its way home at night through dense, tropical forest understory.  The study of how different types of sensory information (visual, chemical, tactile) are processed by amblypygids as they solve navigation problems can reveal fundamental design properties of simple nervous systems that are somehow capable of controlling complex, learned behavior. These design properties can inspire engineering solutions applicable to robotic and artificial intelligence systems. The study of charismatic tropical amblypygids also serves as an alluring gateway for teachers to introduce K-12 students to the importance of neuroscience for understanding how organisms acquire and process information from their environment and how this information influences learning and memory. To support engagement with K-12 students, their teachers and the general public, researchers supported by this grant will develop internet-based educational materials in both English and Spanish. <br/><br/>By conducting behavioral experiments that assess amblypygid (Phrynus pseudoparvulus) movements after displacement from a home refuge, researchers will assess the relative importance of visual, chemical and mechanical information in supporting navigation. These experiments will either involve manipulation of animal sense organs or the sensory cues in their environment. The neurobiological work will focus on a brain area known as ""mushroom bodies"", which are thought to support spatial memory. In parallel with the behavioral work, researchers will explore the nervous system routes by which information from different sensory stimuli is sent to the mushroom bodies. Particular attention will be given to how the mushroom bodies ""engineer"" or ""integrate"" the different sensory inputs.  The integration of sensory inputs is hypothesized to be necessary to support complex navigation and will likely have applied potential for design of sophisticated artificial systems. Finally, the importance of the mushroom bodies in navigation, and their capacity to combine different sources of sensory information, will be tested under the same conditions of the behavioral experiments noted above, except using animals whose mushroom bodies are impaired."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. The process by which new species form (speciation) has long been of interest to evolutionary biologists. Though species boundaries have been documented and revised across the tree of life, this has not led to a broad understanding of speciation. In part, this shortcoming is a function of the approaches used in taxonomic research. Most available methods for uncovering species boundaries using genetic data alone ignore factors that could lend insight into speciation, while methods for combining genetic, phenotypic (trait), and ecological data rely too heavily on concordance across datatypes. The Fellow?s work will develop conceptual models that link process to pattern and allow more meaningful integration across datatypes. These conceptual speciation models will be used to develop and test predictions in taildropper slugs (Genus Prophysaon). This work will provide unprecedented insight into speciation in Prophysaon, and will develop a general framework for process-based studies of species limits in non-model systems. The proposed work will also lead to the publication of a reference genome, the development of a machine-learning approach for testing predictions in genomic data, several training opportunities for undergraduate researchers, and increased taxonomic knowledge in an understudied group.<br/><br/>The Fellow will use three approaches to distinguish among factors driving speciation in Prophysaon: 1) tests of the influence of neutral and selective processes on DNA sequence variation between species, 2) tests of ecological divergence between species, and 3) tests of reproductive isolation between species. The Fellow will use genomic and transcriptomic data, machine learning, electron microscopy, geometric morphometrics, behavioral trials, and metabarcoding of gut contents to test predictions. The Fellow will actively recruit undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups through established programs at Indiana University to collaborate on the proposed work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ?spatio-temporal? concerns are of particular importance to animals engaged in communication with each other: the relative positioning of sender and receiver over time can help to optimize information exchange or hamper it. One key reason for this is that sensory systems and the signals that stimulate them are often highly directional. Take, for example, the courtship display of the male broad-tailed hummingbird, which involves a dramatic high-speed dive, a loud feather-generated sound, and a stunning flash of his iridescent throat. For maximum effect on a prospective mate, the male must time and place these elements of his display perfectly, coordinated with millisecond and millimeter precision. If he doesn?t align his feathers just right in relation to the sun and her perch, his magenta flash doesn?t quite go off. And the female must be looking directly at him. If he?s in the corner of her eye, she may miss most of the show. But how are such spatio-temporal dynamics coordinated by those involved? And do individuals differ in their ability to navigate space and time in ways that impact their success in communication and associated decision-making? In other words, how and why might this aspect of animal communication evolve? Answers to these deceptively simple questions require integration of insights from a number of scientific fields, including neuroscience, cognitive ecology, biomechanics, sensory ecology, computer science, evolutionary biology, animal behavior, and philosophy. Such integration, although challenging, promises to open exciting new avenues of inquiry that should pay dividends across these fields and beyond.  This workshop and symposium series will bring researchers from various field together to begin addressing these questions and others to better understand how signaling is impacted by time and position.  Early career and researchers from underrepresented groups will be recruited to participate at all steps to broaden the investigative process and audience for this work.<br/><br/>The organizing team will coordinate a workshop and symposium, hosted at consecutive annual meetings of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology, to draw together researchers from these different disciplines in discussions about interdisciplinary approaches and novel transdisciplinary paradigms for investigating spatio-temporal dynamics in animal communication. The initial, one-day workshop will partner early career researchers with interdisciplinary clusters of invited faculty to discuss major challenges, key knowledge gaps, and research boundaries in need if increased interdisciplinary crosstalk. These working clusters will then identify a profitable topic for further study in the subsequent 12 months, with a presentation and/or working paper to emerge from such efforts. The follow-up symposium will showcase workshop products alongside cutting edge research in three thematic sessions. One session will address receiver encoding of complex signals from neurobiological, cognitive, and philosophical perspectives. Talks in this session will address how variation in signal spatio-temporal dynamics impact attention, habituation, learning, localization, and scene analysis. The second session will consider biomechanical, neurophysiological, and ecological constraints on display production, with talks addressing both display performance as well as directing displays effectively toward appropriate receivers. The third session will focus on machine learning and social network tool development to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics, as common methods for examining relatively simple displays in dyadic interactions do not capture the full range of features relevant in complex communication networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although the BDD can appear superficially to be wasteland with little variety, in fact it harbors many unique species, comprise the most endangered set of habitats in Brazil, and is being rapidly being lost to agriculture and other human encroachment. This research will be the first to synthesize information from species' traits, communities, and genetics to understand how the unique traits and communities of organisms living in the BDD evolved. Using a diverse set of approaches to study in detail a variety of animals, plants and fungi that today inhabit this broad swath of dry habitats in central Brazil, the researchers will evaluate: 1) what sorts of traits - such as body size, shape or specific behaviors - allow a group of organisms to succeed in a novel environment? 2) how the novel environment determines the set of organisms - the community - that we see today? 3) how organisms adapt genetically and morphologically to that novel environment? and 4) how novel traits, communities, and genetic changes interact to produce the variety of organisms that are seen in different environments today? Answers to these questions will improve scientists' ability to predict the impacts of a changing world on biodiversity. The project will foster new international research collaborations by engaging a large team of experts from the United States and Brazil and will also provide interdisciplinary research training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers.   <br/><br/>To accomplish the four aims listed above, the project will first use a machine learning approach applied to hundreds of traits and lineages in the BDD to determine which traits predict evolutionary success - the tendency for xeric-adapted species to undergo evolutionary diversification. The project will then employ community phylogenetics approaches to understand how functional trait variation is distributed in the BDD, and will determine the evolutionary patterns and over- or under-dispersion of trait values observed in particular communities inhabiting the BDD today, as well as how traits are filtered across habitat gradients. Finally, the project uses a variety of genomic technologies, including whole genome sequencing and transcriptomics, to understand how organisms adapt to the more xeric habitats of the BDD as compared to close relatives living in adjacent mesic biomes. By linking evolutionary patterns in traits, communities and genes, the project will synthesize the functional, phylogenetic and genetic dimensions of biodiversity of the BDD and present a comprehensive portrait of its origins and evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algae grow rapidly when provided with light and a balanced supply of nutrients, and a lack of resources causes slow growth and inefficient filtering of pollutants. Algae require dozens of nutrients, but only two major nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) have been extensively studied in streams. Recent work in the ocean and large lakes has shown that trace metals are important for the growth of algae. This project will provide fundamental understanding of the role of trace metals in the growth of stream algae and explore the consequences of trace metal deficiencies on pollution filtering. This work will also provide experiences for high school and undergraduate students that promote key skills required of modern biology. Modern biology incorporates knowledge from many other scientific fields and this work?s study of trace metals provides an interdisciplinary approach that can be a model for developing scientists.<br/><br/>This project will use experiments from the patch to stream scale to study the extent, cause, and consequences of trace metal deficiency for stream ecosystem structure and function. The project will answer three fundamental questions: (1) How often do trace metals influence algae growth in Great Lakes streams?, (2) How does changing the nutrient balance alter algal communities?, and (3) How does changing trace metal availability alter pollution filtering by algae? The study will use nutrient diffusing substrates (NDS) in 98 Great Lakes streams to identify locations and conditions where trace metals are influencing algae. Ensuing studies will measure algal communities and pollutant uptake rates under different trace metal conditions. Results at the patch scale will be confirmed at the whole stream scale with experiments in artificial channels and divided streams. The project will use NDS experiments in classrooms and laboratories to give high school and undergraduate students authentic research experiences. The researchers will work with the Kent State Upward Bound Math Science program to introduce high school students to interdisciplinary science and provide them with authentic, place-based research experiences in their local streams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work establishes the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) as low-cost (<$1/individual) germ-free model system for conducting hypothesis-driven investigations into microbial community-host interactions at the gut interface. Germ-free P. americana is a useful complementary experimental platform because it shares many of the same gut bacteria found in mammals, many of whom are cultivable, and exhibits many of the same digestive and developmental abnormalities observed in germ-free rodents. The proposed work will reintroduce endemic gut bacteria via fecal transplants and artificial assemblages of cultivated bacteria to identify species that elicit normal development and growth. Future work will exploit P. americana's inherent omnivory to examine how human diets impact gut bacterial dynamics and subsequent host gastric health and development. Furthermore, high-achieving undergraduates from Howard University will be partnered with Ohio State University postdocs and graduate students to participate in proposed activities as summer research assistants and the PI will give contributed talks at historically black universities and Hispanic serving institutions to actively promote academic research careers and recruit high-achieving undergraduates for the Ohio State University summer research opportunities program.<br/><br/>The gut epithelium is among the few sites in which host, microbes and the environment converge with significant evolutionary and ecological consequences.

The contributions of bacterial species to gut health can be challenging because gut communities are comprised of many species with overlapping functional abilities.

The project will yield, as yet undiscovered, fundamental information on the function of YidC, which is key to understanding how biological membranes are assembled, maintain their identity, and support many functions such as signaling and transport. The resulting new knowledge on biogenesis of membrane proteins could also impact human health-related research in the future since membrane proteins make up more than 50% of the known drug targets. The project will also provide opportunities for training students in a multidisciplinary research environment involving molecular biology, biochemical and biophysical approaches.  <br/><br/>The goal of the research is to determine how YidC functions to insert proteins into the cell membrane. YidC is novel as a membrane insertase as it contains a hydrophilic cavity that is crucial for its insertase and chaperone function. YidC can function on its own or cooperate with the Sec machinery to insert proteins. The project utilizes fluorescence spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spin labeling, and single molecule approaches to examine the dynamics and structural relationships of membrane insertion events. The research specifically aims to determine the mechanism of action and dynamics of YidC in membrane protein insertion, elucidate the interactions in the YidC/Sec machinery complex, and identify features of membrane protein substrates that determine selection of YidC and Sec translocase pathways in E. coli.

This project uses computational modeling at multiple scales to elucidate how a class of molecular machines associated with microtubules accomplishes the severing of this largest structure in the cytoskeleton, whose dynamic organization and rearrangement is an essential process of cell division, motility, and development. This research will address a critical gap in our understanding of the dynamic properties of microtubules and their complexes with microtubule associated proteins undergoing wear and their dependence on the magnitude and geometry of mechanical input and will lead to a better understanding of how molecular machines work. The project will provide education and training of undergraduate and graduate students in computational biophysical chemistry by involving them in interdisciplinary scientific projects and increase the participation of groups underrepresented in science through the outreach at local Cincinnati Public School and through research experience opportunities for freshmen students participating in the ""Women in Science and Engineering"" program at the University of Cincinnati. The results of the project will be disseminated to the public by the investigator, postdoc, and students through publications, conference presentations, and visits to local schools. <br/><br/>This project will elucidate the major remodeling action of microtubules performed by severing enzymes from the ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities (AAA+) family. The multiscale simulations will determine molecular and thermodynamic parameters that characterize the breaking of a microtubule filament according to the proposed severing mechanisms. Because the action of AAA+ proteins is known to involve the application of pulling forces on their substrate proteins, in this project simulations that can reach the long time and length-scales required to follow the action of severing enzymes, primarily katanin in its hexameric functional states, will be complemented by experiments conducted by collaborators to extract markers of the unfoldase action on microtubules. Furthermore, the contribution of allosteric transitions between the active states of these hexameric enzymes to microtubule disassembly will be established.

Undergraduate students will have the opportunity to participate in the research, learn important skills in computational biology, and have novel experiences inside and outside of the classroom.<br/> <br/>Birds are well known for possessing a diverse array of songs and calls that mediate social behavior, reproduction, and communication. Within a single species, bird vocalizations change through space and time due to the influence of drift, selection and mate choice, but there is a relative lack of knowledge about how biogeographic history and community dynamics across larger regions influence the evolution of bird vocalizations and speciation. This project will use large datasets available both for bird vocalizations and phylogeography to analyze relationships between vocalizations, geography, history, and community composition, for multiple species, on a continental scale. The project will assess the impact that Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles had on phylogeography and vocalizations within species and across communities and test hypotheses regarding the evolutionary drivers of song divergence. The proposed work will develop pipelines to collect massive amounts of song data, process it algorithmically, integrate it into existing pipelines for the analysis of phylogeographic data, contrast these data to environmental predictor variables, and ultimately test hypotheses of divergence. This work will provide the groundwork for the integration of phenotypic and genetic databases to investigate diversification of bird vocalization on a global scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A novel technique is used to delimit the beginning and ends of genome sequences that cellular machines read and transcribe into transient instructions. Three types of these machines transcribe fundamentally different passages in all organisms, but plants have two additional types that transcribe enigmatic regions referred to as ""dark matter"". In some manner, these ""dark matter"" instructions impact traits of economic interest by helping guide the coordinate reading of the genetic blueprint necessary for proper growth and optimal health. Although these ""dark matter"" regions represent the single largest source of genetic variation in worldwide plant varieties, their functions remains poorly understood. This project aims to decipher some of these functions by evaluating the effects of interfering with the transcription machinery dedicated to these ""dark matter"" regions in diverse maize varieties. The publicly available information, analytical tools, and materials generated by this project will significantly elevate the utility of existing resources and provide an essential reference for novel discoveries in plant biology and genetics. The activities will integrate the training of young scientists at both undergraduate and graduate levels and, in collaboration with the American Chemical Society, provide research experiences for high school students of economic disadvantage. Additionally, educational materials for teaching both basic and advanced genetic concepts will be generated and made available through an existing outreach program of the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.<br/><br/>Gene expression is controlled at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels; yet the contribution of each to RNA abundance is often unknown. In plants, heritable changes to these controls can be impacted by action(s) of Pol II-related RNA polymerase (RNAP) complexes. At least five of these RNAPs are found in grasses but their functional significance(s) remains unclear. This project defines the nascent transcriptional landscape of maize, identifies potential cases of co- or post-transcriptional control, and uses mutant analyses to understand how these Pol II-related RNAP complexes affect gene expression. Specifically, this project will 1) optimize protocols for global run-on sequencing and generate reference nascent transcriptome datasets to enable novel genome annotations; 2) use specific mutants and comparative RNA profiling to differentiate gene regulation due to RNA-directed DNA methylation versus RNAP IV competitions and to allow individual RNA stabilities to be inferred; 3) identify features where regulation is heritably altered in the absence of RNAP IV to catalog epialleles whose transcriptional behaviors resemble those susceptible to paramutation; and 4) use mutant analyses to evaluate the hypothesis that RNAP IV translates environmental perception into changes in heritable transcriptional control. Project outcomes will provide important community resources to understand the nuclear systems that generate and maintain epigenome diversity in a crop species. All data generated from this project will be made immediately available, integrated into existing database frameworks, and promoted through training and outreach opportunities to empower a greater understanding of eukaryotic genetics and the genome biology of crop species."

Telomerase is an enzyme that is responsible for making telomeres, structures that protect the ends of all eukaryotic chromosomes, reminiscent of the hard ends of shoelaces. The genetic mechanism of telomere replication by telomerase is better studied in yeast and mammalian cells; far from each other as those two organisms are, they in fact represent relatively recent branches of eukaryotic phylogeny. In contrast, we study an ancient, deep branching lineage of eukaryotes, kinetoplastid protists. Our organism of choice, Trypanosoma brucei, has telomerase with unique structural and functional properties, and we will learn how this enzyme works. The project will encourage full participation from women and underrepresented minorities in science. Apart from training graduate and postdoctoral trainees, this project will also implement a three-year undergraduate program (BIOKEYS) in both PIs? laboratories; the major goal of this program will be to teach undergraduate researchers to value interdisciplinary sciences early in their research careers. In addition to gaining experience from designing experiments and problem solving using high-end technologies, students will be teaching and learning from each other as part of a research group.<br/><br/>Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein enzyme, provides the major means for elongation of chromosome ends (telomeres), thus counteracting the loss of linear DNA ends in each cell cycle due to incomplete DNA replication by conventional DNA polymerases. Telomerase has two core components, the Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (TERT) that catalyzes telomere elongation, and the telomerase RNA (TER), which provides a template for telomere DNA synthesis. The mechanisms of telomere elongation by telomerase are poorly understood in Trypanosoma brucei, a deep branching Kinetoplastid. Therefore, this project dissects structural, biochemical and genetic features of telomerase RNA in T. brucei to understand the mechanism of telomerase regulation in early eukaryotic species. The recent discovery of the T. brucei TER reveals novel features exclusive to deep branching eukaryotes, suggesting mechanistic differences in the process of telomere synthesis between T. brucei and higher eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, this project: (i) investigates telomerase RNA structure at a single nucleotide resolution using NMR and SHAPE chemistry, (ii) defines key TERT contact sites on TER that are essential for telomerase function in T. brucei using HITS-CLIP technology, and (iii) establishes the functional significance of TR domains by genetic manipulations and telomerase functional assays. Overall, this research will allow significant advances in understanding the mechanistic details of telomerase evolution in protists."

Flexibility of these rhythmic networks is essential for organisms to alter their behavioral output to meet changing demands. An important aspect of network flexibility is that neurons can rapidly switch their participation between networks. Modulatory inputs that project to rhythmic networks can induce neuronal switching through the release of chemical messengers. These chemical messengers alter network activity through their modulatory actions on the properties of neurons and on the synaptic connections between neurons. Determining how individual modulatory actions combine to elicit switching is a major challenge in the field of neuroscience. Small well-defined networks are instrumental in bridging the gap between cellular-level actions and whole network output. In particular, the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) provides access to all network components as well as modulatory inputs to networks, and enables manipulation of individual neuronal properties and synaptic connections. This proposal uses the STNS to identify fundamental cellular mechanisms by which modulatory inputs switch neuronal participation between rhythmic networks. This includes the use of hybrid biological-computational networks to dissect the contributions of individual modulatory actions. This project also advances scientific discovery and learning for graduate and undergraduate students through training in the research lab of the principal investigator and in advanced lab-based courses. Underrepresented groups continue to be incorporated into the lab's research through partnerships with university and elementary school level STEM minority participation programs.<br/> <br/>Interestingly, neuronal switching can include neurons that switch between single and dual network activity. This switching can result in a single neuron expressing two activity patterns at two different frequencies. There is some evidence that modulatory inputs can elicit switching through their actions on synapses and neuronal properties. However, the complex interplay of electrical coupling, chemical synapses, and neuronal membrane properties has limited research at the network level. An identified modulatory input in the STNS causes a neuron to partially decouple from its electrically coupled partners in one network and simultaneously participate in a second network. The objectives of this proposal are to determine how modulatory actions, individually and collectively, regulate switching between a single and a dual network state. These objectives are achieved using a combination of electrophysiological and computational approaches, including hybrid networks in which biological and model neurons are coupled with the dynamic clamp technique. This project aims to identify novel mechanisms by which modulatory actions enable a neuron to become an active contributor to: 1) rhythm generation for two rhythms simultaneously, despite their occurrence at different frequencies, and 2) coordination among different network neurons. Determining these mechanisms will provide new insights into how electrical and chemical synapses can interact with neuronal membrane properties to regulate participation between networks. Increased understanding of how electrical coupling interacts with other network properties also provides a framework for future biological and computational studies in other rhythmic neural networks including those in larger, less accessible systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In animals with backbones (vertebrates), peripheral nerve axons are surrounded by a specialized class of cell, Schwann cells, that physically and chemically interact with the neurons they surround.  This study will use zebrafish larvae to better understand the exact ways that Schwann cells interact with neurons and tissues in their surrounding environment (especially muscle) to create properly patterned and functional peripheral nerves. Zebrafish larvae are used because they are transparent and develop peripheral nerves rapidly, enabling the coordinated development of Schwann cells and neurons to be easily studied using a combination of visualization cell movements and gene expression patterns, together with manipulative experiments in normal and mutant animals. All the experiments in this project are incorporated into collegiate coursework and independent projects for undergraduate researchers, providing technical training and education alongside scientific discovery. In addition, undergraduate students will learn best practices in public scientific communication and participate in community-engaged learning by creating new lessons and discovery center exhibits for elementary and high school students. These programs are designed to develop young scientists by improving their technical skills and lessening the communication gap with the public.<br/><br/>This study aims to define genetic factors that promote migration and differentiation of myelinating glial cells in peripheral nerves. Neural crest-derived Schwann cells coordinate development along axons to provide the necessary trophic support and insulation to conduct rapid nerve impulses. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the interdependent relationship between developing neurons, Schwann cells, and their extracellular environment are not fully defined. To more fully understand these processes, the researchers will take advantage of a novel zebrafish model with muscle patterning defects that disrupt sensory axon guidance and glial migration. This project has three goals: 1) characterize Schwann cell maturation and axon elongation in wild-type and mutant zebrafish larvae, 2) test the hypothesis that a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor functions in body wall muscle to non-cell-autonomously regulate axon elongation and glial migration, and 3) identify muscle-derived guidance cues that are necessary and sufficient for glial cell migration and differentiation using in vivo gene expression analysis and in vitro culture studies. Thus, this study will uncover key molecules that function specifically at the nexus of neural, glial, and muscle development in vertebrates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the scene in an animal's eyes only makes sense if it knows its own body position and movements. While they are moving, animals can also predict how their senses will be affected by their own movements. For example, as a human walks, his eyes bounce up and down with his steps, but he does not see this motion because his brain predicts and ignores this self-generated visual information. Though much is known about how this process works in a single sense organ, less is known about how multiple senses work together to do this. In many animals, the inner ear monitors the position and movement of the body. However, the inner ear is inside the head and difficult to study and manipulate. This project will take advantage of animals with rotation sensors on the outside of their bodies to observe how these organs influence behavior.  In flies, specialized organs called halteres detect body movements and these structures are located outside the body near the wings.  This research will measure changes in fly behavior that occur when the sensory information coming from the haltere is changed and when it does not match information gathered through vision. This work will show how multiple senses are integrated with the animal's own behavior to guide movement. By examining how the brain combines multiple sensory inputs and anticipates the consequences of its own behaviors, this work will uncover mechanisms of the brain's function that can be applied to other species and that can be used to understand biological brains and engineer algorithms for moving machines. The project will also be incorporated into a series of workshops at an all-girls high school with the goal of improving quantitative and computer coding skills in female students. <br/><br/>Distinguishing between self-generated and externally generated body movements is a central challenge for the nervous system. Efference copy, a neural signal of opposite sign to expected sensory input, is a possible mechanism for this distinction. Efference copies have been observed in single sensory systems, but how might they function in a multi-sensory context? Using an animal with a well-understood visual system and an easily-accessible mechanosensory organ, these experiments will investigate how these two sensory modalities combine during voluntary and involuntary movements.  In flies, body rotations are detected by specialized mechanosensors called halteres. These are modified hindwings that perform a function similar to the mammalian vestibular system. This project will investigate the integration of haltere information, visual information, and motor commands through quantitative behavioral analysis of flying flies. Flies will fly under different conditions: flight with imposed body rotations (tethered to a motor), flight with free, self-generated rotations (tethered to pins suspended between magnets), and rigidly tethered flight (no body rotations) with imposed movements of the haltere. The fly's head movement behavior will be observed under these conditions, and the behavior of intact flies will be compared to flies with their mechanosensory halteres removed or manipulated. Finally, information theoretic analysis will be used to quantify the flow of information in the visual and mechanosensory systems and construct a theoretical framework that can be used to understand how information about body rotations is integrated with visual information to control posture and gaze. Taken together, these experiments and model will demonstrate how two sensory modalities are combined and integrated with motor feedback during flight.  Broader impacts include workshops to broaden experience for young women in quantitative and computer coding skills and presentation of the work to various non-scientific audiences. Work completed here has application to the field of robotics and the development of higher quality autonomous aerial robotics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How an animal behaviorally responds to these signals may affect their reproductive success. An example of this is the preference insects have for distinct plants they feed on, based on the chemical compounds emitted from these plants. Specifically, changes in their preferences for chemical signals through changes in their ability to perceive them using their sense of smell (olfaction) can contribute to divergence among populations and species formation. This study will examine the evolution of the olfactory system within a single species, in the context of differences in chemical cues across its geographical range. This knowledge is fundamental to understanding more broadly how genetic and neural variation can result in fundamental differences in behavior. Results from the proposed work will thus document mechanisms by which a species emerges.  It will also have broad implications for applied agriculture. Many herbivorous insects locate food and mates using their sense of smell, resulting in adverse effects on agricultural productivity. In summary, in addition to advancing the understanding of olfaction, this research will serve as a model for understanding the mechanisms underlying divergence in behavior and ecological speciation. Moreover, its integrative nature makes it ideally suited for training students, since it uses behavioral, molecular genetic, and neurophysiological approaches. Outreach activities will include exposing high school students to research through hands-on experiential learning that highlights results from the proposed research and, more broadly, concepts in sensory biology and evolution.<br/><br/>Understanding species formation ideally includes examination of the process prior to its completion. Four geographically distinct populations of the fly Drosophila mojavensis currently exploit four different cactus species that emit specific combinations of volatile chemical compounds that are primary cues for plant identification. The objective of this proposal is to determine the correspondence between variation in olfactory cues, olfactory sensitivity, and behavioral preference for natural odorants. The specific aims are to compare populations of the same species that use different host plants: (1) neurophysiological responses to host plant-specific volatiles, (2) molecular genetic mechanisms underlying different neurophysiological responses, and (3) to determine whether the volatiles eliciting different neurophysiological responses translate into behavioral discrimination. These studies will result in further understanding of how the peripheral nervous system can change in response to changing ecological environments, and how these changes may contribute to population divergence."

RNA editing involves specific alterations of RNA molecules, relative to the genes from which they were copied, and affects expression of genes in mitochondria, the organelles responsible for energy generation in the cell.  Whereas, RNA editing is widespread in many organisms, including humans, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood.  This research will fill that knowledge gap and provide new insights how RNA editing occurs.  The project will also provide training opportunities at many levels through concerted efforts to involve high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  One such effort will be to continue ongoing work with a high school teacher and students to develop experiments that can be done in an inner city school setting.  Specific outreach to women and minority students will help broaden participation in science. Students will take part directly in the research, gaining valuable experience by learning how to optimize methods, master state-of-the-art techniques, and present the results of their work as part of the project's dissemination of the research outcomes to the broader scientific community.  <br/><br/>RNA editing occurs in many organisms and has been most extensively studied in humans and other mammals, plants, and human pathogens. Observed sequence changes include base conversions, base substitutions, the deletion of encoded nucleotides, and the insertion of additional residues. The only organism known to carry out all of these forms of editing is the primitive eukaryote Physarum polycephalum. The sequence of virtually all of the mRNAs, rRNAs, and tRNAs encoded in Physarum mitochondria differs from that of the mitochondrial genome in highly specific and reproducible ways. Many RNAs contain so many non-encoded nucleotides that their genes escaped identification for years. Previous work has shown that ""extra"" nucleotides are added to these RNAs during their synthesis and that the specificity of editing depends on template elements that flank editing sites; however, the underlying mechanism is still mysterious. The major aim of this project is to identify the factors that are required for these site-specific changes to mitochondrial RNAs. Previous work on two different forms of editing has narrowed the list of potential candidates for each type and these will be investigated further. The expression of each of these proteins will be knocked down individually and mitochondrial RNAs will be analyzed to determine whether RNA editing levels are reduced. Once editing factors are identified, their interactions with other mitochondrial proteins will be examined. Long-term goals for the project include the development of an in vitro system assembled from defined components for use in mechanistic studies and the definition of the specific roles played by both template elements and auxiliary factors. Successful completion of these studies will significantly enhance current understanding of how RNA sequence changes can be targeted in an exquisitely specific manner."

Each phenotypic trait requires the cooperation of a collection of genes whose participation is controlled by DNA sequences known as cis-regulatory elements (CREs). CREs work like switches to turn genes ON or OFF in certain cell types at specific life stages. The switch-like function of CREs are encoded in the DNA sequence by short stretches of ordered bases to which proteins known as transcription factors specifically bind. Combinations of transcription factors form a ""logic"" of instructions that determines precisely which cells, and at what time the CRE can switch a gene ON. Currently, it remains poorly understood how switch-like functions are encoded in CREs and how traits evolve through changes in their encoded logic. In particular, the Hox transcription factors represent a poorly understood class that provides CREs with positional information along the major body axis. The Williams and Rebeiz labs are collaborating to study the network of genes and CREs responsible for making a male-specific body pigmentation of the fruit fly species Drosophila melanogaster. The results will inform how such pigmentation originated and was altered in multiple lineages of fruit fly species. The outcomes will show how the construction of a new characteristic is controlled by Hox genes, CREs and how evolution can operate at the level of binding sites for transcription factors. This work will provide a picture of trait evolution that will be applicable to a wide variety of animal systems. Through this research, computational tools will be refined and online learning resources will be created to aid scientists. This research project will support the future of science personnel through the participation of high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students in mentored research. Participation will emphasize students from under-represented groups in science.<br/><br/>The developmental events that pattern the animal body plan are regarded as a crucible for the evolution of novel traits. This project's overarching goal is to understand how body plan patterning information originated in a gene regulatory network (GRN), and was subsequently modified to diversify a morphological trait. GRNs are structured to pattern development through the binding of transcription factors to cis-regulatory elements (CREs) to control gene expression. The combination of factors that bind CREs form a regulatory logic that specifies timing, pattern and levels of expression. Currently, very little is known about how GRN structure evolves to generate different phenotypes. Specifically, which genes in the hierarchy were modified, and ultimately how regulatory logic evolves. The Williams and Rebeiz labs are examining the evolution of a GRN and its underlying regulatory logic for a rapidly evolving trait present in an experimentally tractable animal system. The proposed studies will focus on male-specific patterns of abdominal pigmentation that convergently evolved in two fruit fly lineages, which were then modified and lost. The first aim will characterize how the arbiters of the body plan (e.g. Hox proteins, cofactors, and activity modulators) directly interact with CREs of the GRN to control expression patterns of pigmentation enzymes in D. melanogaster. The second aim will determine how this Hox-regulated GRN was altered in cases where pigmentation was expanded, contracted, or lost in non-model fruit fly species. The third aim will trace how this GRN independently evolved a convergent pigmentation phenotype in a non-model fly. To pursue these aims, the research team will employ techniques that include reporter transgenes in multiple fruit fly species and gel shift assays between transcription factors and CRE sequences to pinpoint phenotype altering mutations and connect these to the alterations in transcription factor binding and function that they inspired."

This project integrates a research program with a new informal education program to enhance both the scientific and public understanding of evolutionary and planetary processes that contribute to species distribution. The research component of this project will assess the importance of evolutionary history in niche modeling that estimates species distribution, with the aim of improving the approach used to select variable environmental layers used in these models. The ability to more accurately predict species distribution under both present and future climate scenarios is essential for identifying and understanding the habitats of species at risk of extinction, modeling the spread of introduced species or medically important invertebrates that can transmit disease, and much more. The findings from the research will be incorporated into the new informal education program that teaches biogeography under a planetarium dome. This program also will leverage the global efforts that have amassed over 1.3 billion specimen records worldwide, as well as technological advances in planetarium software, to visualize biodiversity data in an immersive and dynamic setting. This novel outlet to broadcast digitized data will transform how institutions equipped with planetariums communicate biodiversity data and will create endless opportunities to develop new programs for sharing biodiversity research with the public. Improved public understanding of these complex scientific concepts can facilitate changes in attitudes to the impact of environmental change through increased awareness of the connectivity between planetary processes and life on Earth.<br/><br/>A combined systematic and phylogeographic study of Australian dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae) will be used to assess the importance of evolutionary history in environmental niche modeling. This model-group contains both a relictual Gondwanan and a younger Indomalayan clade that will be assessed in a phylogenetic and ecological framework to explore the heritability of environmental tolerance in closely-related but biogeographically distinct taxa. The evolution of niche dynamics for these biogeographically distinct faunas will be assessed through comparative analysis of niche models, predicted niche occupancy profiles and disparity through time plots. Findings will inform environmental layers selection for future analyses and improve the understanding of biotic and abiotic factors that contribute to species distribution. Beyond informing a key question in evolutionary biology, these results will be integrated into the new planetarium program that aims to improve public scientific literacy relating to species' evolution, ecology and planetary change. Program content will align with Ohio's grade 8 learning standard for STEM and will be presented to museum guests in the onsite planetarium, while offsite school programming will be hosted in a mobile planetarium.  Program evaluation will assess the impact of teaching evolution using planetariums, the contribution of museums to informal education, and best-practices for leveraging curatorial expertise in public and school programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The highly interdisciplinary research will fulfill the urgent needs of low-abundance biomolecules detecting in many biological research areas and provide excellent educational experiences for the students involved in the project.  The design concept and the digital instrument will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses. The students will be trained and prepared with the expertise needed for the next generation of engineers and researchers by being exposed to the underlying engineering/science principles and hands-on experiences.  The research activities will also provide excellent training opportunities for undergraduates and K-12 students.  Through multiple education and outreach programs such as ""High School Bridge"", ""Increasing Diversity in Engineering Academics"" and ""Women in Engineering"" programs at UA, and ""Multicultural Engineering Program"", ""Exploration U Programs"", and the ""Spectacular Science Event"" programs at PSU, we will recruit undergraduate and middle/high school students, with an emphasis on underrepresented and female students, to participate in the proposed research activities. The goal is to extend the learning environment beyond the classroom, motivate the student interests and improve the retention in STEM fields via interacting with experienced researchers.  The proposed education and outreach activities will help cultivate a high-tech environment in Ohio and Pennsylvania, two of the rust-belt states in the nation, and directly impact revitalization of high-tech industry through science education. This instrument is expected to advance cellular and molecular biology research, and become a useful tool for the scientific communities in Northeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania and the nation.  Other societal benefits include improving biodefense, protecting the environment and facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis.<br/><br/>The proposed instrument will advance the field of biomolecule detection for the following innovations and capabilities. First, with the unique design of micropillar cartridges through molecular recognition, measurement of biomolecules can be converted to digital signals. The digital counting does not need tedious calibration curves or involve signal decay. Thus, the measurement will be more robust and reliable. Secondly, one target biomolecule can in principle be represented by one digital spike, which holds great potential for digital detection of biomolecules of ultra-low abundance, at single-molecule resolution. This ultra-high resolution and digitization capability are difficult to achieve with current state-of-the-art methods. Thirdly, this instrument will be a promising universal platform for detecting a broad range of biomolecules. Fourthly, this instrument will enable rapid detection of multiple biomolecules simultaneously by using multiple cartridges. Fifthly, the sensors will have a long shelf life and allow for field applications since the sensors are tolerant of harsh environments. An instrument with these unique capabilities is currently unavailable. This sensitive instrument holds great promise for the analysis of various biomolecules from small-size samples. Thus, it can be utilized to advance many biological research areas including, but not limited to, cell signaling, stem cell biology, neuroscience, tissue engineering, and cell metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

N-Heterocyclic aromatic compounds (NHACs) are a class of small molecules that are pervasive environmental pollutants and pose potential health risks. Both Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus niacini are common soil bacteria that contain enzymes involved in breaking down nicotinic acid, a model NHAC, by different mechanisms. In this project, Professor Mark J. Snider at the College of Wooster and Professor Katherine A. Hicks at the State University of New York College at Cortland, along with their undergraduate research students, will collaborate to determine the biochemical mechanisms that these bacterial enzymes use to degrade nicotinic acid. Project-based laboratories will also be developed at their institutions to strengthen the biochemical curricula on environmental issues. In addition, this project will also educate and motivate the next generation of scientists through the community-based summer camp (BWISER) with middle school-aged girls. This week-long research experience will focus on learning modern chemical techniques for studying the degradation of NHACs and the importance of bacteria in bioremediation processes.  <br/><br/>This research will establish the molecular mechanisms underlying the enzyme-catalyzed degradation of nicotinic acid using a structure-function approach. Nicotinic acid is a model compound for understanding the metabolism of NHACs. Recently, the genome of B. niacini has been sequenced and a cluster of genes putatively identified to code for the catabolic enzymes that degrade nicotinic acid using a novel pathway have been discovered. This project will confirm the proposed functions of the genes by determining the effects of knocking out specific genes using CRISPR technology. Pathway intermediates will be identified and characterized by LC-MS/MS and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Using a combination of mechanistic studies and protein X-ray crystallography, the enzymes involved in activating the pyridine ring of nicotinic acid for degradation will also be characterized. These steps involve unique flavin-dependent monooxygenases that expand the reactions catalyzed by members of this superfamily. Work on the monooxygenases will concentrate on elucidating the structural determinants of substrate specificity and engineering these enzymes for activating a range of NHACs for degradation. Together this project has the potential to build on our understanding of the biochemical strategies bacteria have evolved to degrade NHACs. This work will also provide undergraduate students with training in modern biochemical techniques, skills necessary to answer complex questions about environmental contamination, and preparation for STEM field careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways. Animals have a remarkable ability to maintain stability when faced with unexpected perturbations, which occurs through both passive (mechanical) and active (neural) mechanisms. In flight, passive stabilization relies on the animal's body and wing morphology, while active stabilization also relies on the nervous system to adjust flight. This research integrates museum collections with approaches from biology and physics to develop a better understanding of how different variables work to enhance flight stability using moths as a model system. This research has the potential to impact the future design of engineered devices based on biological design principles. <br/><br/>Museum specimens belonging to the diverse group of moths, Bombycoidea, are used to quantify body and wing morphology, and phylogenetic analyses are used to study their evolutionary dynamics and impact on speciation. The fellow utilizes comparative models of dynamic flight stability (typically used in physics and aerospace engineering) as functions of morphology and kinematics to determine how stability evolves in relation to these traits. The fellow also quantifies the mechanical response to visual stimuli in different species to test whether the sensorimotor system is tuned to interspecific differences in stability. Through this research, the fellow receives training in integrating museum collections with interdisciplinary methods from physics, engineering, and biology. To advance discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning, the fellow acts as a key advisor for a group of interdisciplinary undergraduates at the host institution as they conduct independent research on the relationship between maneuverability and wing morphology. Further, to broaden participation, the fellow and the undergraduate team conduct a lesson at the G.I.R.L.S summer camp at the host institution that uses the museum collections, a wind tunnel, and a 3-D printer to examine the relationship between wing morphology and aerodynamic performance. Finally, the collection of images generated by the fellow are being deposited in public databases, complementing existing efforts to digitally preserve museum specimens.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The processes that coordinate growth, shape generation, and final size are essential to ensure the correct body pattern is made and key features such as limbs are properly formed. In this project, the fruit fly wing will be used as a model to study limb growth. By studying the wing at the beginning of development, when the tissue is simpler, the direct effects of genes that regulate cell growth can be tested. The research will use important resources that have been developed in the nationally funded genome projects and will involve molecular biology, genetics and microscopy. It is expected that a comprehensive view of how a limb is established from the earliest stages will emerge. The genes used in limb development in fruit flies are conserved with other animals, including humans, so that general principals will be learned. To increase public understanding of science, an animated movie will be made in conjunction with the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design. The movie will highlight the beginning of fruit fly genetics, which started a field of research that has fueled the fundamental understanding of animal biology for more than a century.   <br/><br/>As animal body parts and organs grow in size and complexity, cell proliferation must be linked to cell fates so that the final structure has the correct pattern and proportions. A major goal in developmental biology is to understand the link between patterning and growth (scaling) at a mechanistic level. In the proposed work, the small group of cells comprising the wing disc, which become the fly thorax and wing, will be studied as they increase in number from about 30 to 150 cells. In this short time window the major pattern is established. The mechanisms that operate here encapsulate those typical of all growing systems and involve conserved growth factors in the Dpp and Egfr pathways. By studying the regulation of cell-cell signaling and determining how cell fate is linked to domains of cell proliferation, the work is expected to both fill a gap in knowledge about early development of the Drosophila wing and provide insight into fundamental processes shared in all animals. In an effort to broaden public understanding of genetics, the story of the pioneer Drosophila geneticist, Morgan, will be documented in a biographical film. In partnership with ACCAD (Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design), a state-of-the-art graphic film will be made that describes the discovery of the first Drosophila mutant - the famous white-eyed fly. The film will be posted on YouTube for broad dissemination."

Too much can cause problems such as unsightly algal blooms or coastal dead zones where fish cannot live.  The fate of nitrogen is closely tied to the fate of carbon in plants and soil.  However, the connection between nitrogen and carbon remains poorly understood.  In particular, little is known about carbon and nitrogen interactions across different landscapes, from the tropics to the arctic.  This project will help better understand what controls nitrogen leaving watersheds through streams.  It will take advantage of data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network across the nation's diverse environments.  This research is important as people add more nitrogen to the land through air pollution, fertilizers, and septic systems.  It will also help understand how much carbon the environment can absorb as carbon dioxide increases in the atmosphere.  The project will result in new data sets that will be shared with other researchers.  The project team will work with schools and local communities to explain how what happens on land affects water quality.  Findings will be translated to be useful for policy makers.  A diverse group of students will learn how to use environmental sensor technology. <br/><br/>Consistent input and output measurements for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems collected by NEON will be used to address the overarching question: ""How tightly are watershed carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles coupled across biomes and how is this coupling influenced by physical environmental conditions (climate and hydrology), vegetation characteristics, and legacies from past disturbance?"" Hypotheses will be tested related to the role of watershed carbon to nitrogen ratios, precipitation, storminess, temperature, and disturbance using 1) ongoing NEON sensor, manually-collected, and remote sensing measurements to estimate watershed N inputs, N outputs and net ecosystem C exchange (NEE), 2) a terrestrial ecosystem model (PnET) to scale NEE to the entire watershed draining to streams, and 3) analysis of watershed net N and C fluxes against potential explanatory data for each domain. Twenty-two NEON watersheds defined by wadeable streams and proximity of NEE measurements will be used, incorporating a wide range of watershed characteristics.  Watershed budget estimates will include estimates of uncertainty in both C and N fluxes and sinks. Scientific findings will be translated into education and policy relevant information with groups such as LTER Schoolyard program and the Science Policy Exchange.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
