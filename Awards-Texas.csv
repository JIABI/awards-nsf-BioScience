"1924732","Neural Mechanisms of Generalization in the Ventral Hippocampus","IOS","Modulation","09/01/2019","07/16/2019","Isabel Muzzio","TX","University of Texas at San Antonio","Standard Grant","Edda Thiels","08/31/2022","$803,768.00","","isabel.muzzio@utsa.edu","One UTSA Circle","San Antonio","TX","782491644","2104584340","BIO","7714","1096, 1228, 2886, 9178, 9179","$0.00","The tendency to respond in similar ways to different situations, known as generalization, can be adaptive or maladaptive, depending on the context. For example, feeling apprehension when walking down a dark alley in any place in the world can be important for survival; however, displaying fear in well-lit streets is detrimental. These examples illustrate that the context or surroundings can signal when fear generalization is adaptive. The ventral hippocampus, an area involved in memory and anxiety, is in a key position to code contextual valence and use this information to generate selective versus generalized responses. Yet little is known about how this area modulates the expression of these behaviors. The goal of this project is to determine if different cells types within the ventral hippocampus modulate the expression of selective vs. generalized emotional responses. Understanding the mechanisms that control the selectivity of emotional behavior is extremely important because it can serve to explain anxiety behaviors, such as phobias or post-traumatic stress, where fear is continuously expressed in inappropriate contexts. Moreover, understanding the computations underlying generalization extends beyond emotional learning, having potential impact on artificial intelligence and machine learning. To address this question, this project uses cutting-edge techniques, including in vivo recordings of selective populations of cells while animals are learning. Since UTSA is a minority serving institution, this research also provides training opportunities to underrepresented groups and inform the community at large about current scientific issues through an ongoing podcast that serves to showcase prominent neuroscientists.<br/><br/>The ventral hippocampus has reciprocal connections with the basolateral amygdala, an area involved in fear learning and extinction, and it is the main hippocampal region sending projections to the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, areas of the medial prefrontal cortex involved in fear expression and extinction, respectively. Additionally, ventral hippocampus principal cells display large, overlapping firing fields that are ideal for generalization processes. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the ventral hippocampus modulates selective vs. generalized responses though the activity of distinct subpopulations of projection neurons with different physiological and computational properties. This idea is assessed by combining in vivo single unit and local field potential recordings along with pathway-specific chemogenetic silencing/activation and in vitro patch clamping techniques along with optogenetic circuit analysis to answer the following questions: 1) How do subpopulations of ventral hippocampal cells respond and synchronize with target regions when animals discriminate or generalize emotional responses? 2) What is the role of different ventral hippocampus projection cells in generalization/discrimination and how do ventral representations change when distinct subpopulations are selectively activated or inhibited? 3) What are the computational and synaptic properties of different ventral hippocampus projection cells? Since too narrow or too broad generalization can have extremely negative consequences for survival, understanding the neural mechanisms that produce fine calibration of generalization processes is very important.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Investigating neuron morphology is an effective way to analyze neurons, since it plays a major role in determining neurons' properties. Recently, the ever-increasing neuron databases have greatly facilitated the research of neuron morphology. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these data pose significant challenges for computational analysis, preventing the realization of the full potential of such data. This interdisciplinary project will seek for new avenue to assemble the massive neuron morphologies and provide a unified framework for neuroscientists to explore and analyze different types of neurons. The research is able to tackle many challenges in neuroscience which are hard to solve with previous methods, including fine-grained neuron identification, latent pattern discovery and exploration, etc. The large-scale methods being developed will be particularly beneficial in the future of neuroscience, since more and more neurons are reconstructed and added to the databases. The computational methods and tools developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other bioinformatics problems, especially those dealing with large-scale datasets. The broader impact of this project not only includes educational support for undergraduate researchers and high school students, particularly women and those underrepresented groups, but also contributes to the research of neuroscience and other STEM fields.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective computational methods and tools for neuroscientists to interactively explore large-scale neuron databases with ultra-fine-grained accuracy, in real-time. This research has a strong multidisciplinary component that involves a nexus ideas from machine learning, information retrieval, and neuroinformatics. Particularly, novel ideas will be implemented in three inter-related components through the whole framework. The first one addresses the accurate and efficient neuron reconstruction and tracing based on deep learning models. The second addresses the efficient discovery of relevant instances among large-size neuron databases via multi-modal and online binary coding methods. The third part addresses intelligent visualization and interaction schemes for knowledge discovery and mining, equipped with interactive coding that can incorporate domain experts' feedback to enhance the query algorithms for fine-tuned results. Compared with previous methods and systems, this project will open a new avenue to assist neuroscientists analyzing and exploring large-scale neuron databases with high efficiency, accuracy, and robustness. The performance of proposed methods will be validated using public neuro-morphological databases (e.g., NeuroMorpho, BigNeuron) and compared with several benchmarks. The effectiveness of the tools to be developed will be evaluated by neuroscientists on domain-specific hypothesis-driven applications.

How cells self-organize into complex tissues is one of the greatest puzzles in modern developmental biology and a hallmark example of emergent behavior - complex patterns arising from simpler interacting components. Despite tremendous progress, even the best-studied model systems lack an understanding of the emergent properties that bridge developmental phenomena from molecules to cells, tissues, and eventually complete organisms. Biofilms formed by the soil bacterium Myxococcus xanthus are a great model system to study emergent behavior. Under starvation, an M. xanthus biofilm initiates a developmental program during which cells aggregate into mounds and then differentiate into distinct cell types. Many of the genes that influence M. xanthus development have been identified, but researchers lack metrics to systematically understand their role in coordinating self-organization dynamics. This project aims to link genes and emergent behavior through machine-learning-based quantification of the developmental impact of gene disruptions. The methodology developed in this project is expected to be broadly applicable. Broader impacts of the proposal will be further enhanced by training opportunities for students for all participating laboratories, facilitated by close interactions such as joint meetings and trainee collaborations. Furthermore, project outreach will include collaborative efforts to bring 3D-printed microscopes into AP Biology high school classrooms. <br/><br/>Connecting genotypes to emergent multicellular phenotypes is one of the grand challenges of 21st century biology. The lack of robust metrics that quantify the effects of genetic perturbations on emergent patterns significantly impedes our ability to make progress even for relatively simple model systems such as Myxococcus xanthus. Three major problems exist: (1) individual cell movements are inherently stochastic, and their collective emergent patterns display significant variations between experimental replicates; (2) emergent patterns displayed during development are unpredictable and extremely sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions; (3) developmental phenotypes of mutant strains are often subtle and difficult to characterize and quantify. Until these problems are addressed, it may be difficult to separate the phenotypic impact of mutation from the effects of stochasticity and environmental sensitivity. Notably, these problems are not unique to M. xanthus, and therefore their solution has the potential to be transformative across many different biological systems that display emergent multicellular behaviors. Recent advances in application of deep learning in computer vision have demonstrated the power of these approaches to deal with similar problems. Therefore, developed approaches are expected to apply to a wide range of model systems, just as deep-learning-based image quantification methods are being applied to a vast array of images from a variety of fields.<br/><br/>This work is jointly funded by Integrated Organismal Systems (IOS), Molecular Cell Biology (MCB) and the Rules of Life (RoL) venture fund.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will develop, benchmark and disseminate tools that perform deep mutational scanning of every CoV2 protein entirely in silico. A computational analysis of sequence, structure and function across the Coronavirus family will yield the discovery of functional epitopes across the CoV2 proteome and on weighing the functional impact of new mutations in emerging CoV2 strains. The outcome will be to comprehensively map all actionable targets in CoV2 that may then serve, for example, as antigens for pan-Coronavirus vaccines or as docking sites for repurposed drugs. A machine learning search for human host genetic factors that may distinguish between asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 infections from severe to lethal infections will help identify and disseminate human host biomarkers of mortality that personalize preventive measures and treatment modalities, tailored to individual genetic risks.  <br/><br/>The project applies an Evolutionary Action theory that takes an integrative mathematical physics approach to the couplings between sequence variations, protein structure-function and evolutionary divergences. This approach involves computing the evolutionary forces that shaped fitness landscapes, and assessing the energy expended by mutations against these forces as they traverse these landscapes. While most natural mutations exert low energy and little or no impact on function or evolution, a few mutations carry significant energy and reliably change function and fitness. Preliminary data, including on SARS-CoV-2, show that this approach will yield precise and tunable maps of protein functional epitopes and accurate scores of the impact of mutations on function. As a training feature, it will provide a singularly accurate measure of the functional impact of each mutation for machine learning to find which genes are diferentially affected in a group of carriers of a complex phenotype vs a control group.  Because EA is based on fundamental principles of evolution and protein structure-function, it is entirely general and the computational techniques we propose can be deployed to study any virus, bacterium, or eukaryotic system and their interactions. This will lead to broad new insights into the genotype-phenotype relationship, equally useful to research, education, and biotechnology development across all kingdoms of life.

How animals learn about available options has traditionally been studied in relation to a single reward (such as a particular food item). However, animals including humans often have to make decisions that vary in multiple types of reward. The research from this grant will determine how animals make these more complex types of decisions. To do this, bumblebees will be used: these bees visit a wide variety of flower types and in doing so learn to visit the most highly rewarding ones. The majority of research has focused on how bees learn and make decisions based on a single reward from flowers (nectar), despite the fact that bees collect multiple types of reward (the most common being nectar and pollen). This research will increase our knowledge of bumblebee foraging, which is particularly timely given recent bee declines. It will also more broadly inform our understanding of how animals, including humans, make complex decisions. The grant will support a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student and undergraduate researchers. The research will be presented at national and international conferences, as well as to the public through a number of outreach events. Finally, 1-2 high school students per year will work alongside graduate students on research projects, with the aim of encouraging students from diverse backgrounds to pursue careers in science.  <br/><br/>This project will address how multiple rewards affect cognition (learning, memory and decision-making), in three objectives. 1) It will be determined how learning is affected by multiple rewards through establishing how single vs. multiple rewards (nectar and pollen) affect how well a stimulus is learned, and the timing of reinforcement. 2) It will be determined how animals make decisions when choosing between options with multiple rewards, through addressing how bees make decisions between flowers that vary in nectar and pollen quality. For this objective it will also be determined whether absolute or comparative judgement is used. 3) It will be determined how bees? motivational state affects their memory of flowers with multiple rewards, by addressing whether motivational state when learning and remembering affects memory of reward or stimulus quality. All objectives will be carried out using lab- and greenhouse-based experiments with artificial flowers and commercial bumblebee colonies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is unknown what causes some babies to babble more or differently than others in the first place. This project uses an animal model to examine one popular, yet un-tested, hypothesis that the quantity and quality of playmates stimulates cognitive development as displayed by more robust vocal babbling. Early social environment can have dramatic and lasting effects on behavior in highly intelligent animals, but most models of language learning have focused on adult-juvenile interactions; occur in captive or laboratory settings; suffer from small sample sizes; or lack crucial experimental evidence. Capitalizing on a long-term, pedigreed population of wild parrots, this project manipulates the number of sibling nest mates to examine later effects on vocal babbling. Research will also investigate how social play and stress hormones impact learning.  Parrots are good models to examine social influences on language learning because they have the most sophisticated vocal imitative abilities of non-humans, they have long-term pair bonds, and an elaborate and elongated period of juvenile play. Results will provide a firmer foundation for exploring potential pathways involved in early human cognitive and vocal development.  The project is based at a minority serving institution in an economically disadvantaged region of the U.S. long underrepresented in science and math and will provide hands-on scientific training to a large number of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Songbirds have been the main model for research on the neurobiology and neuroendocrinology of vocal imitation. However, song differs from human spoken language in that the former is often restricted to males who learn during a brief sensitive phase in development, a masculinization process in the brain strongly influenced by gonadal steroids; later in adulthood, song is activated by the same androgenic steroids. In humans and parrots, individuals of both sexes use complex lingual articulation of sounds to learn new vocalizations throughout life, but little is known about how the endocrine system mediates vocal learning in both sexes. While a role for sex steroids cannot be ruled-out, stress steroids such as corticosterone tend to be more sex-neutral and can have a profound influence on neural substrates during early development. Work will: 1) quantify individual variation in the spectrographic structure of nestling vocal babbling as a function of brood size and hatching sequence; 2) quantify metrics of social networks and how these relate to patterns in 1; 3) measure adrenocortical responsiveness and any correlations with 1-2; 4) experiment through brood size and corticosterone manipulations to establish causal explanations for patterns found in 1-3; and 5) use path analysis to delineate developmental steps. Given the large variation in brood size (4-11 nestlings), this presents a unique opportunity to test if sibling social interactions foster learning processes indirectly, or directly through provisioning of vocal templates to younger siblings. Either scenario would represent novel learning strategies in birds and transform our view of early psychological development.  Results will be disseminated via publications in peer-reviewed national and international journals and presentations at national and international meetings.  Both undergraduate and graduate student research support is provided as well as international researcher involvement."

Predicting the evolution of behavior presents special challenges, because behavior often depends not only on the individual doing the behavior (and its genes), but also on other interacting individuals (and their genes). Such complex social behaviors may thus evolve in unique ways, termed evolutionary feedbacks. Although evolutionary feedbacks are believed to be widespread, little is still known about how they work to shape evolution over time. In this project, the researcher will take advantage of a powerful model system (fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster), to directly observe evolutionary feedbacks for aggressive behavior as they are happening over multiple generations in the lab.  The research team will evolve highly-aggressive fruit flies under circumstances in which feedbacks are allowed or restricted.  This will allow the team to determine how feedbacks influence evolution across generations, for both behavior and its underlying genes. This research will provide scientific opportunities to community college students. NSF support will allow talented community college students to experience research for the first time, and contribute to educating the broader community.<br/><br/>Evolutionary feedbacks occur when behavioral evolution in one generation results in altered selection pressures in subsequent generations. Despite longstanding hypotheses that feedbacks should be nearly ubiquitous, little is still known about how feedbacks influence behavioral evolution and its underlying genetic basis. This research will fill this gap in knowledge by manipulating evolutionary feedbacks for aggressive behavior in replicate fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) populations evolving under artificial selection for increased aggressiveness. By manipulating the social environment in which artificial selection occurs, replicate populations will be artificially selected under conditions that permit positive, negative, or no feedbacks, alongside unselected controls. Behavioral changes will be tracked across generations, and whole-genome sequences from evolved populations will be compared to identify population-genomic ""signatures of feedbacks."" Individual genes that are putative targets of selection will be transgenically manipulated to determine their effects on behavior(s), allowing direct measurement of whether different feedbacks target genes with different roles in aggressive interactions. Together, these Aims provide the first direct tests of the hypotheses that evolutionary feedbacks alter the rate, trajectory, and genetic basis of behavioral evolution. The results have the potential to reconcile previously-incongruent studies, and will provide a conceptual and methodological framework for studying the ways that social interactions during individuals' lifetimes scale up to influence evolutionary change across generations. The research will support diverse community college students to experience research in evolutionary genetics during the summer. These scientific enrichment opportunities will provide opportunities for diverse students to enter STEM fields while learning about evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The question of whether sleep serves a critical function in learning and memory remains strongly debated.  There are two stages of sleep, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS), and these different sleep stages may play unique roles in memory functions.  This project tests the novel hypothesis that different types of brain waves, slow and fast gamma rhythms, occur during SWS and REM, respectively, and differentially regulate memory processing during these states. The project employs a state-of-the art approach that involves recording electrical signals from the brains of live animals and decoding the messages transmitted by these signals during wakeful learning and subsequent sleep.  The studies are expected to reveal major insights about how memories may be strengthened during sleep.  The results will also make progress toward successful decoding of conscious and unconscious brain activity.  This is expected to promote the development of devices that advance human intelligence through brain signal translation.  This project will also provide scientific training to students at various levels, from junior high to graduate school, and impart knowledge about brain signals to the general public.  <br/><br/>This project will test whether distinct fast (~80 Hz) and slow (~40 Hz) gamma rhythms serve unique memory functions in the entorhinal-hippocampal network during different stages of sleep.  The work has two objectives: 1) Test the hypothesis that slow gamma facilitates hippocampal output to the entorhinal cortex during SWS as part of the memory consolidation process, and 2) Test the hypothesis that fast gamma coordinates entorhinal input to the hippocampus during REM as a different step in the memory consolidation process.  The proposal employs an innovative multi-technique approach combining single cell recordings, neuronal ensemble coding, network rhythms, and animal behavior. The proposed work has the potential to transform theories of memory processing during sleep.  An influential theory of memory consolidation posits that memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex during sleep. Yet, it is unknown whether neurons in the entorhinal cortex, the gateway between the hippocampus and neocortex, respond to inputs from the hippocampus during sleep. If, instead, the hippocampus responds to inputs from the entorhinal cortex during sleep, conventional theories of memory consolidation during sleep would have to be revised."

Overexpression of four-defined factors in fibroblasts revealed that lineage-committed cells can revert to an embryonic-like ground state. These reprogrammed cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have attributes similar to naturally-occurring embryonic stem cells (ESCs); and therefore, have the remarkable capacity to produce all tissue-types in the embryo and self-renew. However, cells with an even greater developmental potential exists during a narrow time window between fertilization and ESC formation. These cells are termed totipotent for their capacity to generate both embryonic and non-embryonic tissues, such as the placenta. Currently, the totipotent state can be achieved by natural fertilization, cloning, or genetic manipulation of ESCs or iPSCs. These approaches are impeded by low efficiency rates and a host of molecular barriers that have yet be identified. Furthermore, totipotent cells are unable to self-renew and propagate; thus, limiting large scale applications. This EAGER grant will test a simple, single-gene manipulation strategy to transform iPSCs or somatic cells entirely into totipotent cells that are capable of self-renewing. Success of the research plan will provide a novel reprogramming strategy that can pave the way to understand a molecular hierarchy regulating the totipotent state and the potential to generate the entire mammalian organism. Capitalizing on this novel technical innovation, freshmen and sophomore students will be recruited from introductory biology courses to learn basic techniques in stem cell biology. This hands-on-student training exercise is part of larger strategy to ultimately enhance retention and graduation rates at a minority-serving institution aspiring for tier-one research status. <br/><br/>Technical Paragraph<br/> Totipotent cells have the remarkable capacity to generate both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues, such as the placenta. Totipotent cells are therefore a defining feature that contributed to the propagation of the nearly 4,000 placental mammals. During preimplantation embryonic development, totipotent cells are present transiently between fertilization and prior to formation of the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst. In addition to natural fertilization, totipotent cells can be acquired artificially by somatic nuclear transfer (cloning) or by eliminating epigenetic regulators in ICM-derived embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, the efficiency of these approaches is relatively low, and require the presence and/or elimination of a myriad of factors that establish barriers to the totipotent state. Strategies to fully-reprogram pluripotent stem or somatic cells to the totipotent state with defined factors therefore remain a challenge. This EAGER grant addresses this challenge, and will test a single-gene manipulation strategy that fully-reprograms iPSCs or somatic cells into totipotent cells. Specifically, totipotent cells acquired by this approach will be challenged with the mouse chimera assay. This rigorous approach will determine whether newly-acquired totipotent cells have the potential to generate both embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. Successful completion of this research program will profoundly impact the scientific community by providing an alternative reprogramming strategy, insight into a molecular hierarchy regulating totipotency and preimplantation embryonic development. As part of the Broader Impacts of this grant, undergraduate students will be recruited to the lab to engage in basic methodologies in stem cell biology. Targeting freshmen and sophomores is part of a larger strategy to help retain and enhance graduate rates at a minority-serving institution striving for tier-one research status.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team tests a hypothesis that autoinhibition can reduce the risk for the proteins to get trapped at nontargets and thereby accelerate the binding to the targets. This international project, supported by both NSF and BSF, involves educational outreach for high school students that demonstrates for students the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the universal nature of science across the globe. The project can provide an innovative way to engineer the molecular properties of proteins for various biotechnological purposes. <br/><br/>This project is theory-driven and integrates approaches of experimental and computational biophysics in a synergistic fashion to shed light on the fundamental principles of autoinhibition. The research team will study the role of autoinhibition of DNA-binding proteins in their target search process in the presence of numerous nonfunctional high-affinity ligands, which are referred to as decoys. During the search process, DNA-binding proteins encounter with numerous decoys, which can severely impede association with targets. The research team will examine the dynamic autoinhibition as a potential mechanism to diminish this adverse impact of decoys. The autoinhibition that undergoes dynamic conformational equilibrium will be studied for natural and artificial systems where an inhibitory segment and ligands (decoy or target) compete for the positively charged molecular surface of a DNA-binding domain. The research team will pursue two specific objectives: 1) to delineate competition of intra- vs. inter-molecular interactions; and 2) to elucidate the role of dynamic autoinhibition in target search kinetics. The research will utilize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods, stopped-flow fluorescence methods, and computational approaches. The project is expected to delineate what dictate the balance between the autoinhibited and uninhibited states and how the balance influences the target search kinetics. The project will also explore applications of the dynamic autoinhibition to protein engineering for improving the kinetic properties of DNA-binding proteins.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Molecular Biophysics and Genetic Mechanism Clusters of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in Biological Sciences Directorate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Inside the cell, they catalyze chemical reactions, perform mechanical work, and assemble into larger structures. The collective action of very many proteins drives cell growth, division, and movement. Proteins are often controlled by external signals ? for example, adding a nutrient to the cellular environment might turn a protein ?on? or ?off? by binding to the protein and altering its shape or dynamics. Such allosteric control provides a basic mechanism for cells to sense and respond to the environment and is a building block for intracellular communication. A complete understanding of how allosteric control works, and how it is encoded in the genetic sequence of proteins, would allow biologists to engineer proteins that respond to artificial cues.  In this project, the PI?s research team will use computation and experiment to understand how allosteric regulation in a protein is optimized, define physical properties distinguishing allosteric surfaces, and construct a set of synthetic allosteric switches that enable control of cell growth rate with light. This work will establish a practical, general toolkit for engineering allosteric regulation, and provide fundamental insights into how natural allosteric regulation might evolve. This proposal will train graduate, undergraduate, and bio-oriented high school students to improve their skills in basic programming and research experimentation to contribute STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>Though allostery is a fundamental and common feature of proteins, how it is encoded by protein sequence and structure remains unclear. For example, it is unknown if the pattern and number of mutations influencing allostery is sparse or abundant, or if the mutations with the biggest effect on regulation are localized to the allosteric site or distributed throughout the structure. This project will address these fundamental questions by using deep mutational scanning to characterize the complete set of mutations than can influence allosteric regulation in a synthetic allosteric switch. This research will also use new approaches in NMR spectroscopy to better understand how protein interactions with water might determine (and identify) allosteric surfaces. The hypothesis is that allosteric surfaces are marked by slowed hydration dynamics. If so, this would suggest that allosteric sites are entropically preferred sites for the evolution of new protein and ligand binding interactions. Moreover, this would open new avenues for the discovery of allosterically acting pharmaceuticals. Finally, the knowledge gained through these mutational and structural studies will be applied to generate a series of broad dynamic range allosteric switches for the light-based control of cell growth. These switches will provide a practical toolkit for dynamically modulating cell growth, with potential applications in the study of bacterial community dynamics, eukaryotic cell proliferation, and engineering live biotherapeutics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their diversity is staggering, with more than 500,000 species thought to exist. These minute wasps (mostly 1-2 mm in size) are numerically abundant and common in almost every habitat. The smallest of these wasps are smaller than a typical single-celled organism, and yet the adults can fly, locate their hosts, deposit their eggs, and as larvae, consume their insect hosts. Most chalcidoid wasps are parasitoids; they feed on their insect hosts, eventually killing them. A few groups have also evolved to attack plant hosts and some serve as pollinators. Species attack all life stages from eggs to adults, and live and feed either internally or externally. Some are parasitoids of other parasitoids and some may even feed on their own species. Because they kill other insects, these wasps are extremely important for the control of pests of agricultural and forest crops, as well as vectors of human disease and veterinary pests. The economic importance of these wasps in pest management is unparalleled. They are widely used in biological control programs against major pests, with outcomes documented to result in decreases in pesticide, increases in yield, and in landmark cases direct savings of billions of dollars or permanent pest control. The evolutionary events leading to this enormous diversity in morphology, biology and rates of diversification are poorly understood, leading to an artificial system of taxonomic classification. In this research project, researchers will use a diverse array of molecular, morphological and bioinformatics approaches to develop a solid understanding of the hierarchy of relationships across the entire group. These relationships will then be used to reclassify major groups to reflect common ancestry, to provide a framework for a web-accessible portal to manage and deliver information on their diverse biology, and to explore the evolutionary changes that have driven and shaped this enormous radiation of terrestrial insects.<br/><br/>The objectives of the research project are to 1) generate a robust molecular phylogeny of the Chalcidoidea using new data from transcriptomes and targeted DNA enrichment for over 400 species, 2) generate morphological data for over 200 fossils from Eocene and Cretaceous amber and combine these with a comprehensive morphological data set for extant taxa, 3) develop a revised classification of Chalcidoidea in book form through a series of workshops and worldwide collaborations, and 4) make available information on the taxonomy, biology and distribution of over 31,000 available names and information in over 40,000 references. The project will train two postdoctoral researchers, one graduate student and several undergraduates. To involve the wider scientific community, a worldwide group of biocontrol researchers and taxonomists will develop a new classification for Chalcidoidea. With groups of Research and Extension Specialists, the project will develop posters, fliers, specimen education kits, and other educational materials for use in the classroom and by extension specialists, agricultural advisors, master naturalists  and master gardeners, and the general public to develop a greater interest and understanding of this charismatic and and important group of insects."

The brain is an enormously complex system, and the analysis of brain data is thus an equally enormous challenge. Human brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of synapses (junctions); and each of them is unique in their basic biochemistry, functions, and dynamics. The brain is also a multi-level system organized across different spatial scales, ranging from genes, synapses, and cells to circuits, brain regions, and systems. Today, brain science is experiencing rapid changes and is expected to achieve major advances in the near future. Recent technological innovations are enabling scientists to capture the gene expression patterns, connectivity, and neuronal activities at increasing speed and resolution. This is generating a deluge of data that capture the brain activities at different levels of organization. To attack the central challenges of analyzing these new data, this project will develop a class of efficient, integrative, multidimensional, predictive, and correlative techniques and use them to analyze large-scale, high-resolution, and multi-modality sets of brain data. Specifically, this project will develop analytics tools to predict the cellular-resolution, brain-wide connectome (""wiring diagram"") from genetic transcriptional profiles. This analysis will elucidate the information pathway from genes to connectivity and ultimately, to function. This project will also integrate other brain dimensions by performing multidimensional network correlative analytics. In addition, this project will address the relationship between gene expression, cell types, and brain structures. The success of this project will be a new class of efficient, robust analytics methods that are flexible enough to be adapted for integrating, modeling, and mining current and future brain data.<br/><br/>The results of this project will have an immediate and strong impact on multiple disciplines, including brain data analytics and computational neuroscience, biological image informatics, and big data analytics. A future long term goal is to uncover basic underlying differences between normal and impaired brain functions. The unified treatment of brain data analytics will be readily transformable into new courses for training next-generation computational biologists. The multidisciplinary nature of this project provides unique opportunities for integrating its components into existing curricula. Brain science has been shown to be a valuable resource for inspiring scientific interests in K-12 students. Components of the project will be integrated into an existing high-school student internship program, thereby inspiring future science students. Underrepresented students will be especially encouraged to participate throughout the project.

Many plant species, including some agricultural crops, have arisen as a result of genome duplication. This natural event results in offspring having genomes that are doubled in content or more as compared to their parents and may have provided opportunities for innovation during plant evolution. However, the short- and long-term consequences of genome duplication in wild plants are not well understood. This research will investigate the natural rate of genome duplication in a wild moss species distributed in North America and Europe. Researchers will create experimental, genome-duplicated offspring in the laboratory to measure how their morphology and reproduction differs from that of their parents. They will then determine if and how duplicated genomes may change over time by comparing the experimental, genome-duplicated offspring  to those that occur naturally. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of early-career researchers. They will also host regional outreach lectures for K-12 teachers about best-practices in evolutionary biology education. Researchers will engage the public online using the citizen-science iNaturalist platform and will create bilingual (Spanish/English) blog posts about moss biology and polyploid evolution. <br/><br/>This project will expand our understanding of the consequences of autopolyploid evolution in plants. Researchers will use as an experimental model organism the moss species Physcomitrium pyriforme (Funariaceae, the Funaria moss family), which harbors a morphologically-diverse complex of seven karyotypes worldwide. The species is annual, bisexual, selfing, and is easily grown in the laboratory. Unlike most other plant model organisms, its genome content can be doubled with precision in vitro to create autopolyploid offspring. Researchers will compare reproductive barriers among naturally-occurring and artificially-induced autopolyploids as well as their homoploid progenitors. Project outcomes will include a phylogeny of the Physcomitrium pyriforme species-complex based on genome sequence data, an estimate of ploidy changes within the complex over evolutionary time and among populations today, and the description of new species. Researchers will further develop the HybPiper bioinformatics data analysis platform and train other US scientists in this method to enhance research capacity.

Unlike many double-stranded DNA phages, ssRNA phages do not have a pressurized capsid or a ""tail"" to inject the genomic material into the host. Instead, they recognize specific bacteria through a single phage capsid protein, the maturation protein (MP), which binds both the phage genomic RNA (gRNA) and a special structure of the host bacterium termed the retractile pilus which is a spear-like component of the bacterial secretion system. It is thought that the retraction of the pili brings ssRNA phages closer to the host; and upon further retraction of the pili, the bacteria intake the MP/gRNA complex along with the recycled pilin subunits, a strategy similar to the ""Trojan horse"" used by the Greeks during the Trojan War. While this property can have immediate biotechnological application to efficiently deliver large quantities of foreign RNA into a host bacterium, the mechanisms of how the MP recognizes a specific type of pili and how the MP/gRNA complex translocates from the phage capsid to the cell are still not clear. This project is directed at investigating these processes and compares the results of two related model E. coli ssRNA phages, MS2 and Qbeta, which provide insights into the structure and dynamics of the interaction between the virus and its host. The project will be accompanied by a rich broader impact program that includes unique interdisciplinary training activities, a seminar series to future STEM teachers, and the generation of online-accessible animations and movies to be used by the public and STEM teachers in their classes.<br/><br/>The structure and dynamics of the interaction between the ssRNA phage MS2 and the E. coli F-like type IV secretion system (F-T4SS) will be studied by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), fluorescence microscopy, cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), molecular biology and computational modeling. This project has two objectives. Objective 1: Molecular mechanism for the host attachment of ssRNA phage.

(a) The relationship between pili retraction and ssRNA entry will be established by time-resolved wide-field fluorescence microscopy. (b) The MS2 gRNA entry dynamics will be elucidated by live-cell super-resolution microscopy. (c) The path of the gRNA into the cell will be revealed using smFISH super-resolution microscopy and electron tomography.

Conventional wisdom holds that animals - from humans to fruit flies - choose the ""best"" partner based on that partner's vigor and health, but more and more work has shown that reproductive decisions are heavily shaped by one's own personality, psychology, and experiences. In particular, people and animals who are bold and extroverted tend to seek different mates and act differently during courtship than those who are shy and introverted.  Part of this may have to do with learning - extroverts learn better from positive rewards, introverts learn better from negative experiences. This project explores the genetic and behavioral connections between personality, learning, and mate choice.  This is done by testing mate preferences, shyness and boldness, and learning ability in the same individuals, and by using genomic technology to search for a common genetic basis underlying these features.  This work will help us understand how reproductive decisions change with the environment and drive the origin of new animal species. The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A main focus is to expand an ongoing mentorship program focused on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students. In this project, high school and college-age students will be trained during the school year as counselors for an elementary-level STEM summer camp focused on animal behavior and local natural history, applying their science knowledge towards engaging younger students.<br/><br/>Hypotheses about the origin and maintenance of mating preferences have focused on their adaptive value with respect to mating decisions. A growing body of work has shown that biases unrelated to mating, notably at the sensory periphery, can shape mating preferences. If these biases are under divergent ecological selection, this can facilitate reproductive isolation. This project focuses on whether interspecific differences in mating preferences can emerge from personality, an ecologically important suite of behavioral traits. The swordtail fish species Xiphophorus malinche and Xiphophorus birchmanni diverge in both mating preferences and personality traits. The proposed project seeks to unravel the common mechanisms underlying personality, preference development, and mating decisions. This will be accomplished by (1) measuring phenotypic correlations between non-sexual exploratory and risk-avoidance behavior, mate-sampling patterns, and mating preferences; (2)  using aversive and appetitive conditioned-response paradigms to evaluate the relationship between personality and learning mode; (3) characterizing the relationship between learning in sexual and non-sexual contexts; and (4) using hybrid genetic lines to elucidate genetic covariance between personality and preference and identify candidate genomic regions.  The project will support graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. A primary objective is expansion of an established mentorship program out of the CICHAZ field station in central Mexico, which currently focuses on community outreach and high-impact learning experiences for high school students. Under the current proposal, high school and college-age students will be trained during the school year as counselors for an elementary-level STEM summer camp focused on animal behavior and local natural history, applying their science knowledge towards engaging younger students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Phosphate is an essential nutrient, but is also a major component of agricultural runoff and water pollution.  Increased photosynthesis and transport of sugars from leaves to growing organs was hypothesized to increase overall growth, but new evidence argues that this creates an imbalance in the ratio of photoassimilated carbon (the sugars produced by photosynthesis) and available phosphate, and causes stunting.  More phosphate restores growth, but also contributes to more runoff.  The implication is that efforts to improve photosynthesis and growth while simultaneously reducing phosphate requirements may be imperiled unless the interaction between carbon and phosphate is understood and uncoupled.  This proposal aims to differentiate between two possibilities.  1) The carbon/phosphate interaction is predominantly a biochemical limitation: more carbon in growing tissues triggers a need for more phosphate-containing metabolites.  2) The plant measures the carbon/phosphate balance, and excessive carbon is recognized as a phosphate deficiency even though none exists.  These will be tested through physiological, genetic, and metabolic experiments to learn if the links between carbon transport and phosphate needs can be uncoupled. This work will reveal strategies that can be used to increase productivity while reducing fertilizer needs. In addition to traditional training of students in the research laboratory, broader undergraduate participation will be achieved by incorporating some aspects of the project into the upper level Plant Physiology laboratory undergraduate course. The approximately 30 students who take the course each year will learn principles of genetics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics. This will not only give hands-on biotechnology experience in an active-learning environment, but also will be used as an opportunity to explore the Genetically Modified Organisms 'GMO' debate with a group of undergraduates who might otherwise be unlikely to engage with this important societal issue.<br/><br/><br/>Enhanced sucrose transport from source leaves to sink organs should improve crop yields by providing more resources for growth while relieving product inhibition on photosynthesis. Over-expressing sucrose transporters (SUTs) in the phloem enhances transport but causes stunted growth originating from a perceived phosphorus (P) deficiency: P-starvation genes are up-regulated and the effect is reversed by P supplementation. P is a non-renewable essential element and a component of agricultural runoff, such that reducing P requirements while maintaining yields are also prominent challenges. One possibility is that more sucrose causes stunting by sequestering too much P in metabolic intermediates. Another possibility is that signaling between carbon (C) and P provokes preparation for  P-limitation. These will be tested through experiments that include 1) growth with phosphite as a phosphate analog to separate signaling and biochemical effects; 2) reverse and forward genetics to identify genes that modulate C:P interaction; 3) transcriptomics to capture gene-expression reprioritization during Suc-induced P-limitations; 4) metabolic analyses to capture metabolome remodeling during Suc-induced P-limitations; and 5) physiological experiments with gain and loss of function lines to learn if C:P links can be uncoupled."

Although substantial research efforts have revealed how the levels of fats and sugars are controlled by different hormones, such as insulin, the connection of these processes to processes that regulate iron levels is poorly understood. Recently, the investigators identified cellular processes that potentially integrate the ways that iron and lipid levels are maintained. The investigators will determine the dynamics and interaction between iron homeostasis and synthesis of specific lipids (ceramides), and how these interactions impact organismal functions such as metabolism, cell death and responses to stress. A genetic model system will be used to identify novel genes involved with cellular iron and lipid homeostasis. Additionally, the investigators will incorporate their research with education by providing research opportunities and mentoring to graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, an outreach-based learning module will be incorporated into the existing and successful UNT Elm Fork Education Center. This science education center reaches over 20,000 visitors per year (majority are K-8th graders).

Utilize genetic analysis to determine if neet-1 and ceramide biosynthesis mechanistically interact to regulate mitochondrial functions. The proposed research could have a transformative impact on the way sphingolipid/ceramide metabolism and iron regulation is viewed in the context of mitochondrial homeostasis. The project provides research training for graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, an outreach-based learning module that focuses on the genetic model system C. elegans will be offered through a program at the UNT Elm Fork Education center. This outreach program will have a broad impact since it reaches over 20,000 visitors per year."

The aim of this research is to identify and develop a novel set of genetic tools that allow brain researchers to label and manipulate brain circuits with increasing sophistication. In this project, expertise of virologists and neuroscientists is paired in order to design new, cutting-edge approaches for studying and manipulating brain circuits. These novel tools provide important methods for mapping the intricate connections between nerve cells that support learning and behavior.

Research in humans has found correlations between early experiences and cognitive-behavioral traits. This project will test these relationships using manipulative experiments with swordtail fish. Previous research in fish has determined that a particular kind of stressful social interaction known as sexual conflict (where males and females disagree over mating rates) can lead to an increase in female brain size. Meanwhile, other research has suggested that having to navigate different kinds of social interactions (also known as social complexity) may result in enhanced cognitive capabilities. The research will test these two competing hypotheses by controlling social conditions during rearing in a fish system that exhibits social complexity and sexual conflict. There are three different types of swordtail males, which represent different levels of sexual conflict towards females (high, low or intermediate sexual conflict). By raising female swordtails in social environments that vary in the type of males present, researchers can quantify how sexual conflict and social complexity shape adult behaviors (including anxiety, aggression and sociability), cognition (learning abilities), and determine which brain regions grow or diminish in response to different social experiences.  This research will have broader impacts that affect both local and national students through the investigator's efforts to incorporate her research into local high school outreach program and the Freshman Research Initiative course at the University of Texas, and through student-initiated national media products (YouTube) on this research.<br/><br/>Sexual conflict, the mismatch in optimal mating rates between the sexes, is ubiquitous across animals. While the morphological consequences of this struggle are well-studied, less is known about the behavioral and cognitive consequences of sexual conflict. In this study, the investigator will experimentally examine the developmental effects of sexual conflict in the swordtail fish (Xiphophorus nigrensis), which has three alternative male phenotypes that represent different levels of sexual conflict towards females: courting males (low conflict), coercive males (high conflict), and males who both court and coerce (mixed conflict). Female swordtails will be raised from birth to early adulthood in one of five social environments that vary in levels of both sexual conflict and social complexity.  At adulthood, females will partake in a broad range of assays to determine how social experiences shape behavioral and cognitive traits. These assays evaluate anxiety, sociability and exploratory tendencies as well as associative learning, cognitive flexibility and social cognition capabilities.  Female brains will be examined to determine how social environment influences the development of distinct brain regions and receptor distribution of candidate social pathways including isotocin and synaptic plasticity markers. The results of this experiment will identify how the social environment influences the development of behavioral tendencies, as well as directly test competing hypotheses for enhanced cognition and brain development (sexual conflict versus social complexity). It will also identify which brain regions (focusing on the social decision-making network) undergo differential development in response to specific social interactions associated with conflict and complexity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the importance of molecular structures, images of biomolecules are extensively used in biochemistry and molecular biology textbooks and classrooms. However, these figures are usually static and do not fully convey complex structure/function relationships that happen in three dimensions, especially to novice undergraduate learners. Furthermore, instructors seldom explore whether students can extract key structural features and relationships from them. This project will develop strategies and assessments for evaluating students' biomolecular visual literacy skills by creating a network of biochemistry and molecular biology instructors. Working in teams, these instructors will develop assessments with improved accessibility for colorblind individuals that probe students' visualization skills. Following a peer-review process, a subset of these tools will be made freely available on an online repository. By working as a trans-institutional community of practice, the network of instructors will facilitate more robust and more universally understood instruction in the visualization of biomolecules.<br/><br/>This project will use the previously developed molecular visualization framework at BioMolViz.org. The BioMolViz framework defines twelve overarching themes in visual literacy that are subdivided into learning goals and objectives. To further populate it, assessment instruments will be created to evaluate student progress in achieving the visual literacy learning objectives in the four overarching themes identified by educators in our previous work as being of greatest importance to the community--monomer recognition, alternate rendering, molecular interactions, and structure-function relationships. Following creation and peer review, iteratively revised questions will be piloted in classrooms of network members. Item-response theory will be applied using the Rasch Model to further test the instruments for reliability to determine which items should be included in the online repository.

The investigators of this collaborative project will study this question in weakly electric fishes from Africa, known as mormyrids. The team has previously discovered a protein, encoded by the gene kcna7a that has undergone intense natural selection mormyrids, which allows mormyrids to produce extremely short electric signals called an electric organ discharge (EOD). Despite the strong selection on mormyrids for brief EOD pulses, the evolution of pulse duration varies dramatically across the more than 200 species of mormyrids, and long duration EOD pulses have evolved at least three times from short-duration EOD pulse ancestors. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that the long-duration EODs are the result of selection acting on amino acid substitutions in the kcna7a gene. In this project, the investigators will test this hypothesis by examining the biophysical properties of kcna7a in species that secondarily evolved long duration EODs, and conduct field-based behavioral studies to determine the selective factors that lead to the evolution of long duration EODs. This project will enhance infrastructure for research by adding data products, refined functionality, and tools to the broadly utilized EFISH Genomics Web Portal, promote teaching and learning by ongoing mentorship of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates associated and broaden participation by continuing the productive relationship with a network of institutional partners to recruit talented personnel from underrepresented groups, working with Huston-Tillotson University, a HBCU in Austin, TX.<br/><br/>A major goal of 21st century biology is to understand how changes at the molecular level result in phenotypic changes at the organismal level. Despite the growing progress in unraveling the ""molecular basis of phenotype"" in a wide variety of taxa, it is important to maintain the view that forces at higher levels of biological organization shape phenotypes from the ""top down"". In many systems, these factors are well known, but their precise connection to identified genetic variants is still poorly understood. In electric fish, the selective forces that influence electric phenotype are known, the loci that produce them are identified, the specific nucleotides within these loci that affect function are characterized, and these loci are known to be targets of selection on macroevolutionary scales. In Specific Aim 1, this project will: determine the biophysical basis of secondary evolution of long EOD pulses by sequencing kcna7a in species that secondarily evolved long duration EODs and their congeners with short duration EODs, measuring their biophysical properties, examining the role of specific sites using site-directed mutagenesis, and determining whether secondarily derived long-duration EODs evolved once or multiple times in parallel. In Specific Aim 2, the investigators will determine whether species that produce long duration EODs have long-duration APs and, and whether properties of kcna7a currents are sufficient to lengthen them, using a combination of electrophysiology and computational modeling. In Specific Aim 3, the investigators will determine the selective factors that lead to the evolution of long duration EODs using by performing field studies in Gabon West-Central Africa.

This Neurotechnology Hub will improve the 3DEM instrumentation to collect information in greater detail, develop better algorithms to process the information, and link the workflows with high performance computing to greatly increase the rate of knowledge discovery. These innovations and capabilities will be shared with the scientific community through active training on the approach, and through open access to the new software and data. By way of this Neurotechnology Hub, 3DEM will become part of the national infrastructure for neuroscience research. To help address the grand scientific challenge of understanding the brain, this project will apply the improved 3DEM approach across several different mammalian species including humans to identify similarities and differences, and their relationship to behavior, learning, and memory.<br/><br/>This Neurotechnology Hub is motivated by challenges in understanding synapses, the tiny points of inter-neuronal communication. The variance in synapse dimensions, connectivity, and subcellular content across species is simply not known, yet required to determine whether model systems represent human brain functions. Current approaches are limited by resolution, inefficient data collection, and analysis bottlenecks. Addressing these challenges, the project will: (1) Develop simultaneous multi-detector and tilt-tomography on the scanning electron microscope operating in the transmission mode. Add-on hardware and software will improve axial resolution from 45 to 10 nm (or less), while maintaining in-plane resolution of 1-2 nm. (2) Integrate automated and interactive tools that speed and improve analysis of synapses in large data volumes. The enhanced resolution will increase data volume but reduce major image processing difficulties by producing more isotropic images. (3) Integrate the enhanced electron microscopy (EM) with high performance computing to increase throughput; to disseminate images, metadata, analyses, and software in a way that facilitates uptake into existing cell type and brain databases; and to provide a venue to develop 3DEM communities.

But the ability to generate data on genome structure and variation has outpaced  understanding on how to use it to infer evolutionary history and species relationships. This project will analyze the impact of genomic features on evolutionary inference in the cat family. Because cat species relationships are well understood, genomic data are available for several species, and genetic tools are available that allow detailed analyses, cats are an excellent system to investigate how chromosome characteristics and structural variation in the genome affect evolution and the inference of evolutionary history. This study promises to have a large impact on the field of systematics and evolutionary biology. This study also has broader impacts on society. Cats are consistently ranked as the most charismatic and recognizable symbols of wildlife and animal conservation, and provide a gateway to engagement and learning about biology and evolution across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. One of the most important project outcomes will be the development of a website by student recruits and researchers, describing and integrating research outcomes with information on the members of the cat family, and connecting these to the public.<br/><br/>Using the remarkable radiation of the cat family Felidae as a model system, this project will generate high quality genome sequence assemblies from all living species to identify the impact of chromosomal characteristics on the accuracy of species tree inference. Novel computational algorithms will be developed to search, sort, and characterize genome-wide variation in topology, tree shape and divergence time, and connect this variation to genomic features predictive of the species tree. The ultimate goal is to understand which chromosomal features have positive and negative influences on accurate species tree estimation, to guide future principles and applications of phylogenomics.

Research supported by this project will map the chromosomal locations where one such yeast plasmid attaches, and then characterize the plasmid and host factors that contribute to hitchhiking. The experimental approaches will utilize current genome-wide methodologies that will be performed by post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high-school seniors (as summer trainees). The findings from this study will be incorporated into 4-5 lectures on Selfish DNA that will form part of an upper division undergraduate course and a first year graduate course.

High School seniors from urban areas of minority and low socioeconomic status will also participate in a program of supervised research. In coordination with UTeach Outreach Institute, a learning module on ?Selfishness of Genes and Genomes? designed to awaken scientific curiosity among middle and high school students will be developed. Overall, this scientific undertaking is expected to have far-reaching societal impact by advancing basic science, developing new technologies and contributing to human health.<br/><br/>Current evidence suggests that the partitioning system of the yeast 2-micron plasmid tethers plasmid sisters formed by replication to sister chromatids, enabling their chromosome-like 1:1 segregation. Yet direct proof of this hitchhiking model is lacking. According to the investigator's working hypothesis, interactions between plasmid partitioning proteins and host chromatin binding proteins are responsible for plasmid localization to chromosomal loci. The researchers will identify and characterize plasmid tethering sites on chromosomes by two independent but complementary high-throughput approaches: ChIP-seq and 4C-seq. The expectation is that there will be considerable overlap between DNA sequences enriched by the two methods. By refining the data from the two approaches using multiple controls, and by filtering the data sets from one against the other, the investigators will be able to define authentic plasmid tethering sites on chromosomes with high confidence. They will then test how tethering efficiency and plasmid stability are affected by mutational inactivation of a number of plasmid and host proteins that are implicated in tethering. This study will provide the most rigorous test of the hitchhiking model for plasmid segregation and will impact a model for the convergent evolution of chromosome-coupled survival strategies among selfish DNA elements as diverse as the yeast plasmid and mammalian viruses. It will thus shed new light on the mechanistic understanding of the shared lifestyles of selfish DNA elements that inhabit evolutionarily distant hosts. It will also help design simple, effective and innovative strategies for maintaining beneficial extra-chromosomal elements in eukaryotic host cells and for eliminating harmful elements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will focus on microtubule nucleation, the poorly understood process by which ??-tubulin units self-assemble to initiate a new microtubule.

The project also emphasizes an educational impact. Graduate students working on the project will receive interdisciplinary training that includes quantitative biochemistry and computational modeling. Outreach partnerships with local elementary and middle schools will bring the excitement of doing science to underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students, while providing teachers and their pupils access to high-tech, but relatively inexpensive, digital microscopes to facilitate curiosity-based learning and discovery. <br/><br/>The specific research objective of this proposal is to create a molecular understanding of microtubule nucleation. Dynamic properties of microtubules derive from the biochemical properties of individual ??-tubulin subunits and their interactions within the polymeric assembly.

However, not all parts of an organism grow at the same rate, and so changes in access to nutrition during growth can affect the ultimate size of different parts of the body differently.  Although the effects of nutritional variation on relative trait size are well documented, only recently have the tools become available to (i) enable study of how genetic and developmental mechanisms manage the growth of traits to produce a properly proportioned adult and to (ii) enable study of how these mechanisms change to alter growth patterns to produce size diversity among species.  Here, the investigators will take a novel approach by changing diet in lines of fruit flies, each possessing their own unique and known genetic code, to identify the specific genes underlying the regulation and integration of growth among various parts of the body.  This research will be coupled with a new, fun elementary school computer-based learning activity where students will alter the relative growth of structures in virtual creatures, transforming young humans into fantastical beings.<br/><br/>Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a genotype to express different phenotypes across environments.  It is well studied on a phenomenological level, particularly for morphological traits; phenotypic plasticity can hinder or promote adaptation, lead to the genesis of evolutionary novelties or serve as an adaptation itself.  A lack of experimental tools has meant that two components central to the evolution of morphological plasticity - the variation among individuals in the expression of plastic responses and the proximate bases of this variation - are essentially unknown.  Nutritionally-induced size variation is common to all metazoans: nutritional limitation during ontogeny generally produces smaller individuals than does a nutritionally rich diet, although the degree of nutritionally-induced size plasticity can vary dramatically among morphological traits.  Such differences in relative trait plasticity are rooted in recently identified developmental genetic mechanisms that regulate and integrate the growth of traits in response to nutritional variation.  Frankino (PI) and Shingleton (co-PI) hypothesize that variation in these same mechanisms underlies the evolutionarily important variation among genotypes in trait plasticity. Here, they propose to test this hypothesis by:  (i) applying new methods to create and quantify the among-individual variation in nutritionally-induced trait and body size plasticities; (ii) using genome-wide association mapping to identify genes that contribute to this variation, and; (iii) employing a series of developmental assays to confirm the role of these genes in producing among-individual variation in nutritionally induced size plasticity."

Despite significant advances in systems and synthetic biology, protein function in cells remains hard to decipher due to the plasticity and adaptability of cellular regulatory and quality control mechanisms. The overarching goal of this project is to generate a platform technology to modulate the accumulation of target proteins in cells. This technology is expected to provide exquisite dynamic control over protein expression, thereby providing a tool to study protein function. A series of complementary strategies will be explored to achieve stimulus-dependent control over modulation of protein expression and to deploy this technology to study complex biological processes. As a result, this study is expected to promote progress of fundamental science , advance the bioeconomy, and enable advances in healthcare.  By providing broad reaching educational and training opportunities to students belonging to underrepresented groups, this project is also expected to support education and diversity and to benefit society. <br/><br/>To overcome the limitations of existing methods for regulating protein steady state levels, the research team built a platform for modulating protein expression post-translationally using a bifunctional system consisting of a molecular recognition unit for target specificity and selectivity, and a degradation-signaling unit that specifies the rate and mechanism of degradation of the target protein. The goal of the proposed research is to engineer this technology to generate a universal platform for controlling protein levels through exogenous or endogenous stimuli. To achieve this goal, three research objectives will be pursued: 1) engineer stimulus-responsive degradation of protein depletion, 2) enhance the dynamic resolution of stimulus-dependent circuits through controlled reporter depletion, and 3) decipher and manipulate the hypoxia signaling network. This research program will be leveraged to provide training, research, and mentoring opportunities for high school teachers and students from the Greater Houston area, and to improve teaching and learning for college students."

Those daily rhythms are governed by an autonomous circadian pacemaker. Although the molecular mechanism of the circadian rhythm generation has been studied in depth, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of novel circadian pacemakers that can oscillate without the canonical circadian molecular machinery.  These novel pacemakers are revealed by the activation of a reward system. With state-of-the-art circadian behavior recording apparatus and real-time circadian gene-reporting developed by the principal investigator, this project uncovers the functional significance of the novel non-canonical circadian pacemaker revealed by palatable meals. This project provides opportunities to individuals at all stages of learning, from high school students to postdoctoral trainees, to participate in experiments that advance understanding of the role and function of the non-canonical circadian pacemaker. An additional goal of this project is to extend scientific knowledge to a young generation of learners. To this end, the principal investigator and trainees engage in outreach programs to share their knowledge of circadian rhythms in classrooms of underrepresented middle and high school students in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.<br/><br/>The mammalian circadian system is a hierarchical network of oscillators optimally coordinating behavior and physiology with daily environmental cycles. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is at the top of this hierarchy because it synchronizes to the light-dark cycle, which is often the dominant environmental cycle. The laboratory of the principal investigator recently discovered that timed access to a palatable meal reveals an endogenous behavioral rhythm in mutant mice, of which all the canonical circadian oscillators were genetically disabled. This revealed rhythm, the palatable meal-inducible circadian oscillator (PICO), persists for several cycles under ad libitum feeding after termination of the palatable meal feeding schedule. In this project, the investigator uses molecular tool sets to examine the role of and map the dopamine reward input pathways that evoke the PICO-driven behavior rhythm. This project also uncovers how the SCN and PICO coordinate circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues and optimally tune physiological events to adapt to environmental daily cycles. The project thereby will transform current understanding of the multi-oscillator circadian network in mammals, which is critically involved in the temporal regulation of physiology and behavior to optimally adapt to daily changes in the environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microtubules will be used as the model system for this research. Microtubules are polymers made from a protein called &#945;&#946;-tubulin, and they play essential roles in organizing the inside of the cell and in partitioning the genetic material during cell division.  By integrating diverse approaches this research will decipher and quantify the connections between the underlying structural and biochemical properties of individual &#945;&#946;-tubulin proteins and the complex polymerization dynamics that emerges from their collective interactions. In addition to advancing the understanding of a process of fundamental importance to cell biology, the project emphasizes educational impact. Graduate students working on the project will receive interdisciplinary training. An outreach partnership with a local elementary school will expose underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students to the fun of doing science while providing them and their teachers with access to high-tech but relatively inexpensive digital microscopes to facilitate inquiry-based learning and discovery. These outreach activities will also provide new opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other members of the UT Southwestern community to become involved in science education.<br/><br/>The specific problem to be studied is microtubule catastrophe, the sporadic switch from microtubule growing to microtubule shrinking. The goal is to provide a convincing and testable molecular explanation for experimental measurements of catastrophe, specifically how frequently catastrophe occurs as a function of the concentration of the polymerizing &#945;&#946;-tubulin subunits. The research will combine a variety of approaches including predictive computational simulations, use of mechanism-specific site-directed mutants of &#945;&#946;-tubulin, and in vitro biochemistry and reconstitution. Using this set of tools, we will (i) incorporate three different biochemical mechanisms into a computational model for microtubule dynamics and determine how each mechanism affects prediction of catastrophe; (ii) perform experimental tests for neighbor coupling in the microtubule lattice, something that has been hypothesized to occur but that has not been previously testable; and (iii) measure how mutations to an interacting triad of residues that is conserved in &#945;- and &#946;-tubulin affect microtubule polymerization dynamics and the conformation(s) of &#945;&#946;-tubulin inside and outside the microtubule.

The investigators of this collaborative project will study this question in weakly electric fishes from Africa, known as mormyrids. The team has previously discovered a protein, encoded by the gene kcna7a that has undergone intense natural selection mormyrids, which allows mormyrids to produce extremely short electric signals called an electric organ discharge (EOD). Despite the strong selection on mormyrids for brief EOD pulses, the evolution of pulse duration varies dramatically across the more than 200 species of mormyrids, and long duration EOD pulses have evolved at least three times from short-duration EOD pulse ancestors. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that the long-duration EODs are the result of selection acting on amino acid substitutions in the kcna7a gene. In this project, the investigators will test this hypothesis by examining the biophysical properties of kcna7a in species that secondarily evolved long duration EODs, and conduct field-based behavioral studies to determine the selective factors that lead to the evolution of long duration EODs. This project will enhance infrastructure for research by adding data products, refined functionality, and tools to the broadly utilized EFISH Genomics Web Portal, promote teaching and learning by ongoing mentorship of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral associates associated and broaden participation by continuing the productive relationship with a network of institutional partners to recruit talented personnel from underrepresented groups, working with Huston-Tillotson University, a HBCU in Austin, TX.<br/><br/>A major goal of 21st century biology is to understand how changes at the molecular level result in phenotypic changes at the organismal level. Despite the growing progress in unraveling the ""molecular basis of phenotype"" in a wide variety of taxa, it is important to maintain the view that forces at higher levels of biological organization shape phenotypes from the ""top down"". In many systems, these factors are well known, but their precise connection to identified genetic variants is still poorly understood. In electric fish, the selective forces that influence electric phenotype are known, the loci that produce them are identified, the specific nucleotides within these loci that affect function are characterized, and these loci are known to be targets of selection on macroevolutionary scales. In Specific Aim 1, this project will: determine the biophysical basis of secondary evolution of long EOD pulses by sequencing kcna7a in species that secondarily evolved long duration EODs and their congeners with short duration EODs, measuring their biophysical properties, examining the role of specific sites using site-directed mutagenesis, and determining whether secondarily derived long-duration EODs evolved once or multiple times in parallel. In Specific Aim 2, the investigators will determine whether species that produce long duration EODs have long-duration APs and, and whether properties of kcna7a currents are sufficient to lengthen them, using a combination of electrophysiology and computational modeling. In Specific Aim 3, the investigators will determine the selective factors that lead to the evolution of long duration EODs using by performing field studies in Gabon West-Central Africa.

This seaway teemed with marine life. Snails and clams lived on the seafloor; ammonites, along with giant mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks, and fish, swam about; at the same time early birds and pterosaurs floated on or flew above the seaway. What remains today is a prolific fossil record that has been collected by paleontologists for over 100 years. Notable fossils from this time period and region are on display at museums around the world. However, the vast bulk of fossils collected from this region are locked away in museum drawers. To provide scientists and the general public access to these fossils and their associated data, this project proposes to digitize invertebrate and vertebrate fossils from this time period and region, making information accessible through searchable electronic databases. Additionally, a variety of online resources illustrating and describing these fossils and mapping their distributions will be developed. A freely accessible online textbook of paleontology will be generated and a website and App will be developed to highlight the appearances, occurrences, and ages of constituent species, to help students and aspiring paleontologists identify and learn about these fossils. The project plans to generate a variety of curricular materials for K-12 education, including 3-D scans of fossils for free download and printed 3-D models for classroom use. Products of this project will also include workshops to engage science teachers and items to augment public programs and exhibits at participating institutions. <br/><br/>This work will greatly increase the scientific value of eight major U.S. museum collections of fossils. The museum collections contain large amounts of data useful for studying what causes marine species to migrate, go extinct, and evolve during a long period of greenhouse climate conditions similar to those our planet may soon experience. These data have relevance for evaluating how global change has and will continue to affect life on earth. An estimated 164,000 specimens collected from thousands of locations, in the region once occupied by the Western Interior Seaway, will be databased and georeferenced. Representatives from each of roughly 1,500 microfossil, invertebrate, and vertebrate species will be imaged. The digitized records will be made available online via individual museum databases, iDigBio, and iDigPaleo. The resultant data will enable scientists to answer questions about how different species interact and ecosystems change in the face of environmental shifts during a key time in the history of life. Moreover, the data will be ideal for use with an assortment of modern quantitative tools -including paleoecological niche modeling (PaleoENM) - and will help improve paleoclimate and paleoceanographic models.

A premier example is the toxic chemicals in the skin of poison frogs. Because these frogs are brightly colored, predators such as birds and snakes learn to avoid them. These toxins are alkaloids, found in many animals and plants. The frogs acquire these chemical defenses by eating ants and other arthropods that contain the alkaloids. These frog alkaloids (e.g., tetrodotoxin, batrachotoxin) are pharmacologically important and cause muscle paralysis, and disrupt breathing and cardiac function. At the cellular level, alkaloids affect ion channels, which control the transmission of nerve impulses. Surprisingly, the ion channels of poison frogs are are not affected by their own toxins; thus, deciphering how this evolved has important broader impacts that translate to human health.

There are existing tools to image brain activity, but they have important limitations, such as being too slow to follow fast brain activity, having poor spatial resolution, being unable to record from many brain cells or only allowing imaging at the very surface of the brain. The investigators of this project are developing new sensors for imaging brain activity in animal models, thereby providing the research community with more powerful tools to study the brain in health and disease. The investigators engineer ""voltage indicators,"" which are proteins who emit flashes of light when neurons are active. Previous studies demonstrated the potential for this technology, but developing better versions is laborious and time-intensive. Here, a new methodology for rapidly improving voltage indicators is being developed and disseminated to the broader community of neuroscientists and other biologists. The technology enables users to obtain improved versions on an accelerated timescale. The project also affords multi-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Monitoring voltage dynamics in defined neurons deep in the brain is critical for unraveling the function of neuronal circuits, but is challenging due to the limited performance of existing tools. The investigators address this technical need by developing Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators (GEVIs), membrane-based fluorescent proteins whose brightness is modulated by transmembrane voltage. This emerging technology promises to fulfill the dream of recording electrical activity from many cells or subcellular locations in vivo and with cell type specificity. While GEVIs have enabled a restricted number of experiments in vivo, further improvement of their performance will be needed for broader use of these probes in vivo. In particular, GEVIs would benefit from increased sensitivity, brightness and photostability. To address the limitations of current indicators, the investigators are developing a microscopy platform that can rapidly screen indicator variants by automatically monitoring the variants' fluorescence responses to voltage changes. The investigators also are constructing several libraries of indicator variants, focusing on residues that are important for sensing the electrical field, or controlling fluorescence excitation or emission. The resulting indicators are characterized comprehensively across all key performance metrics to facilitate deployment in downstream applications.

These microbial communities, or microbiomes, are made up of hundreds of species of bacteria, but which species are present, and how common they are, varies from individual to individual animal. This variability is important because abnormal communities can lead to conditions that range from obesity to depression. However, the rules by which microbial communities come together or breakdown are poorly understood. Using wild bats as models, the researchers will investigate how host sociality, diet, genetics, and microbe functions and interactions shape the make-up of digestive microbiomes.  The results of this research to understand the rules governing microbiome composition can help advance human and wildlife health. To improve students' understanding of how scientific research is conducted, the team will engage elementary school students from around the country in the project, sharing data live from the field in real time. Students will learn how to analyze and interpret the project data through the researchers' STEM K-12 initiative: The Malaysian Bat Education Adventure.  Using an existing Biodiversity module (grades 5-6) and a new module ""Microbial Diversity: What's in your bat?"" (grades 6-7), students will be introduced to topics of microbial ecology and diversity. The program's success in changing student STEM knowledge, skills and attitude will be evaluated with quantitative methods in a pre- and post- intervention design with control group.<br/><br/>The research will determine the relative role of community processes in structuring gut-microbial composition and function in insectivorous bat species co-distributed across a gradient of habitat degradation. The researchers hypothesize that microbiome community assembly and disassembly involve deterministic processes of niche filtering, species interactions, and dispersal. This research will test the hypothesis that changes in host ecology wrought by habitat degradation will alter the relative influence of these processes with consequences for community composition and function. Bats will be studied across a forest modification gradient in Malaysia, and individually-matched samples of gut-microbial composition, metagenome function, dietary composition, host genotype and measures of social interaction obtained for each bat. These data, in conjunction with analyses of co-occurrence, phylogenetic and functional trait patterns, will be used to test structural equation models specified to untangle the processes structuring communities in a causal modeling framework. Evidence of the role of dispersal in structuring microbiomes will derive from comparisons of co-distributed host species that differ in sociality. Interspecific associations will be assessed using co-occurrence network approaches. Functional trait space is developed from genomic inference for each bacterial phylotype within an individual bat's microbiome. Phylogenies are estimated using maximum likelihood and 16S gene alignment among community members. To test the role of diet and host genetics (the host environment) in community processes, the researchers describe diet from feces with the COI DNA barcodes, and quantify host diversity and relatedness through genome fingerprinting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The complex tissue system studied here, the Enteric Nervous System (ENS), functions autonomously within the walls of the gut, regulating intestinal movements and homeostatic functions. While it is generally understood how the ENS functions, currently very little is known about the processes ENS progenitor cells use to self-assemble into nervous tissue and form circuits during embryological development. Greater knowledge about how the ENS is generated will facilitate advances in tissue engineering strategies, as well as helping us to better understand how cells get sculpted into specialized tissues. The research addresses two fundamental issues: 1) the cellular behaviors that orchestrate the very first steps in vertebrate ENS formation, and 2) the genetic and molecular mechanisms that underlie these initial steps of ENS construction. Experiments capitalize on the ease of manipulation and optical transparency of zebrafish embryos to quantitatively and mechanistically analyze ENS formation starting from its earliest progenitor cell populations. In addition to supporting graduate student training in quantitative biology and neuroscience, this award will support both the academic-year and summer training of economically-disadvantaged undergraduate students, concomitant with the arrival of the first class of undergraduate students admitted to attend Rice University tuition-free. Additionally, a novel course module will be implemented for students to learn effective scientific communication via the development of critical writing and visual/oral presentation skills; and hands-on zebrafish experimental workshops for local community-college students will be developed and delivered in an outreach capacity.<br/><br/>How and when neural progenitor cells transform into vertebrate enteric nervous system (ENS) neurons has been difficult to study in vivo in mammals, due to the relative inaccessibility of in-utero embryos at the necessary stages of development, and the internal position of the gut within those embryos. The research uses optically-clear, externally-developing zebrafish embryos to overcome these barriers, and identify how enteric neural progenitor cells (ENPs) migrate and embed within their native gut microenvironment. ENP cells can be directly tracking and experimentally manipulated to a degree that is infeasible in other systems. Experiments will quantitatively and functionally analyze ENP cell transformations into ENS using cutting-edge single-cell genomics, high-resolution time-lapse confocal microscopy, computational analyses and quantitative dissection of cellular behaviors over the full course of ENS development. The results from these studies will be used to create mechanistic models to describe the molecular and cellular emergence of ENS from ENPs along the gut microenvironment. Taken together, these results will provide a novel mechanistic framework for understanding how ENS emergence gets orchestrated, and will help transform our scientific understanding of how progenitor cells are sculpted to form specialized cell networks and tissues.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through this award, oUTCT will partner with the oVert (openVertebrate) project to make nearly nine terabytes of existing high-resolution X-ray computed tomographic (HRXCT) data publicly accessible, and to train the next generation of students in best practices for these data.  Scientists from around the world have brought their most important and precious natural history specimens to UTCT to image and measure their interior features nondestructively.  This application of HRXCT technology has been tremendously successful, resulting in the proliferation of scanners at institutions across the country.  Over the course of two years, oUTCT will upload HRXCT data for 90 UTCT clients to MorphoSource.  About 3000 specimen scans, representing nearly 1,500 fossil and extant vertebrate species, will be made available so they can be easily discovered and downloaded by everyone from scientists to artists to K-12 educators.  This mobilization will be accomplished by undergraduate students employed at UTCT, who will learn the basics of HRXCT data acquisition and visualization as well as basic bioinformatics.<br/><br/>The UTCT datasets, acquired in part via dozens of NSF grants and cited more than 18,000 times in academic publications, remain in high demand due to their broad scope, high data quality, and historical significance.  This demand has been fueled in part by the public-facing Digital Library of Morphology (DigiMorph.org), an NSF-funded project online since 2002 and housed at UTCT, which serves HRXCT-derived animations for more than 1,000 biological and paleontological specimens.  In the oUTCT project, UTCT and DigiMorph will partner with oVert and iDigBio, both at the University of Florida, and the MorphoSource data repository at Duke University to make this unparalleled collection of HRXCT datasets more readily discoverable and more easily repurposed.  As part of the educational outreach for this project, oUTCT will also provide training to the oVert community, which spans nearly 20 universities and academic institutions, to maximize the scientific impact of that project.  The UTCT will host two short courses per year, cosponsored by oVert and iDigBio, to train students and scientists associated with oVert and MorphoSource in the fundamentals of HRXCT data acquisition, visualization, analysis, and long-term management. These activities will expand the impact of the original oVert project and maximize the return on NSF?s investment in it, UTCT, DigiMorph, iDigBio, and MorphoSource.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
