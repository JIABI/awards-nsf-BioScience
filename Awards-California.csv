Forest devastation by beetles and fire, the collapse of the Atlantic cod fishery, or the outbreak of a disease may all be examples of such sudden changes. Effective management of oceans and forests is impaired by abrupt shifts between productivity and crisis. A revolution in how we collect data, from satellites and micro-sensors to large-scale observatories will make new data-hungry machine learning approaches to forecasting and management across these scales feasible yet the net gain in clarity remains unknown. This research seeks to evaluate how the tools of machine learning and artificial intelligence can improve the ability to predict and manage sudden ecosystem change, and understand the limits where it cannot. Empowering the next generation of ecologists and environmental scientists to understand these tools sufficiently to make informed decisions is key to realizing this vision. An integrated research and education program will tackle these questions through an innovative pedagogical approach that seeks to promote diversity at this interface between data science and ecological and environmental issues.<br/><br/>This research seeks to advance current knowledge in ecological forecasting and decision-making by adapting and combining machine-learning algorithms with mechanistically motivated models and emerging ecological data sources. The first phase of the project assesses the effectiveness of recurrent neural network architectures to predict dynamics in ecological systems that are capable of sudden regime shifts ? a setting where theory suggests existing machine learning approaches are likely to fail. This research then seeks more robust forecast design by combining machine learning approaches with mechanistic models guided by ecological theory. The second phase of the project seeks to draw on emerging methods in reinforcement learning to address common optimization problems in conservation, such as determining sustainable harvest levels or the location of protected areas. Here, research will blend recent developments in ?deep? reinforcement learning with process-based approaches to ecological management. Both phases of this research will be supported by the development of open source software tools for implementing these approaches in a wide variety of contexts. Results of the project, including updates and links to resulting scientific publications and software products can be found at https://carlboettiger.info.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is now well-known that COVID-19 infections can spread from hosts early, before onset of symptoms, which implies efficient viral entry and egress. The root causes of COVID-19 induced inflammation are less known, but cognate effects have been seen in other superviruses such as the coronavirus for the original severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the 1918 pandemic influenza virus. This research investigates the basic molecular mechanisms of how parts of this virus can mimic the functions of defensive molecules from the human innate immune system which restructure membranes and control inflammation, thereby allowing the virus to achieve both of the above effects. The multidisciplinary nature of the research will also provide training opportunities for students at multiple levels.<br/>  <br/>The overall goal of this project is to perform basic research that may help mitigate the current COVID-19 crisis by using artificial intelligence informed fundamental biophysics, immunology, and virology.  The project objectives are two-fold. 1: use machine learning methods to identify molecules encoded in the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that remodel the membrane for viral entry and viral shedding, and design ways to turn off this activity by mimicking molecules found in bats, which harbor many coronaviruses and therefore have more evolved defenses against them. 2: Identify molecules from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that mimic molecules from the human innate immune system which are known to mediate potent inflammatory responses, thus allowing potential downstream design of molecular approaches to alleviate this type of inflammation.  These ideas will be tested using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments performed at state-of-the-art 3rd generation synchrotron radiation facilities in the US, as well as traditional immunological and antiviral experiments, including those done at high containment biosafety level 3 facilities designed to handle SARS-CoV-2. Expected results from this basic research project can provide translational guidance for design of COVID-19 treatment strategies, even if current vaccine candidates fail.<br/> <br/>This RAPID award is made by the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, using funds from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ways in which major brain parts that are structurally distinctive have changed over evolutionary time are also poorly understood. These knowledge gaps are partly due to the fact that fossil brains are rare and have been difficult to study. This project features scientists from three collaborating laboratories who will pool their resources to identify a set of invertebrate brain centers that mediate learning and memory. Structural and functional similarities and differences among these areas will be established across modern insect and crustacean species. The major question this research is answering is whether these brain centers share common genetic and computational attributes due to the brain?s fundamental organization being inherited by the descendants from a common ancestor; or, because brains that have arisen independently in different invertebrate groups are not able to perform certain functions unless brain areas that give them these same abilities have also arisen independently. These questions will be answered by precisely measuring the brain structures in fossilized invertebrate animals and comparing their basic arrangements with modern counterparts. The broader impact of this research will be to identify invertebrate proxies of the learning-and-memory brain centers found in vertebrate animals alive today, including humans. Identification of such proxies will inform us about how brains have evolved, and will contribute to a broader understanding of how memory centers are organized. The results will impact theories of, and research on, neural networks and artificial intelligence, and at the same time the scientists carrying out this research will develop novel strategies for identifying genealogical correspondence of brain structures across a very broad range of species. Brains analyzed for this research will be digitally reconstructed in 3D and uploaded to an open-source database for education and research purposes. The research will also provide advanced neuroscience structural analysis and genomics training to students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>The neuronal organization and circuit properties of insect mushroom bodies are well known, as are their functional properties for learning and memory. While the existence of mushroom-body-like centers exist across arthropods, it is not known whether these phenotypically or genotypically correspond to the centers in insects. The planned research will identify mushroom body-like centers across a broad range of species, analyze their discrete neural arrangements, circuit organization, and molecular attributes. These comparisons will identify the species within and outside Arthropoda that possess functional and morphological correspondences in these structures. Transcriptomics will address whether phenotypically-corresponding centers share common genomic attributes, and whether there are unique genetic networks that define arthropod mushroom bodies or whether these networks differentiate mushroom bodies in different groups of arthropods such as in insects and crustaceans. The identification of broad phenotypic and genotypic homology of these centers across a broad phyletic spectrum would suggest an ancient origin of these learning and memory centers. Equally intriguing would be results suggesting convergent evolution of learning and memory centers across taxa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include the branches of trees and the circulatory systems of animals. These networks vary widely in their form. Some only branch, while others form loops. Some have multiple levels of hierarchy, while others do not. This variation may reflect evolved solutions for solving diverse environmental and structural challenges. This project will study key network functions in plants, including transport efficiency, resistance to damage, and mechanical strength. There is little theory linking network form to these functions, or for predicting tradeoffs among these functions. Moreover, very few networks have been fully characterized for structure or function due to the difficulty of collecting the data and describing network architecture.  Better understanding the rules underlying network architecture will provide insights into the evolution of diverse organismal forms. The principles identified in this research could one day guide the engineering of artificial networks such as solar cells or synthetic organs that could benefit society. The project will also support career development undergraduate researchers via a comprehensive mentoring program aimed at inclusion of underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>This project will use leaf venation networks are a model empirical system. Leaves are central to plant performance via their roles in carbon gain and water loss, processes mediated by resource transport through their venation networks. These networks have high diversity of form and function and are tractable to phenotyping and functional characterization. This project will 1) quantify network architecture in a phylogenetically broad set of 500 species from temperate forests, desert, and lowland/montane tropical forests, 2) determine how network architecture and functions/costs are linked, 3) develop and test theories for these functions/costs of networks based on multi-scale network statistics, and 4) identify macro-evolutionary drivers of network architecture.

In the absence of effective therapeutics and vaccines, a deeper understanding of the impact of societal measures (distancing, contact tracing, quarantining, etc.) on local Covid-19 outbreaks are needed  by administrators and healthcare professionals in making decisions that affect the tradeoff between the physical health of individuals and the economic health of communities.  The aims of the proposal are twofold. First, to use cutting-edge statistical models to uncover the factors that most affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission and mortality rates. Second, to provide decisions makers with a simple-to-use, extensive instruction supported, data and scenario analysis (DASA) platform for evaluating the implications of different policy measures, including the implementation and relaxation of social distancing behavior, surveillance, contact tracing, patient isolation, and vaccination (once suitable vaccines are available).  Additionally, this DASA platform will be suitable for training students at the undergraduate and graduate levels in public health and allied programs, as well as providing an analytical tool for students carrying out epidemiological research.<br/><br/>The epidemiological model that underpins the Numerus Model Builder DASA Covid-19 platform includes modifications of the standard SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed/Latent, Infectious, Recovered) formulation to incorporate an explicit contact (C) class, as well as dividing infectious individuals into pre/asymptomatic (A) and symptomatic infectious (I) disease states to yield a SCLAIV model (where V refers to naturally vaccinated/recovered class). Individuals in the C class can either thwart (return to the S class) or succumb to (move onto the L=E class) pathogen invasion after making contact with the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen.  The formulation also includes a parallel series of Sr, Cr, Lr, Ar, Ir and Vr classes that correspond to individuals moving into these reduced-exposure SCLAIV-response classes at rates determined by the driving actions of Covid-19 policy measures that have been put in place. The values of the SCLAIV+reponse model parameters are influenced by various factors that will be identified using statistical machine learning methods.  In particular, ?superlearners? that are a mix of parametric and nonparametric ensemble machine learning methods will be used to identify the factors responsible for observed spatio-temporal patterns across different, regional Covid-19 outbreaks, using appropriate data scraped from the worldwide web.

The host institutions for the fellowship are the Joint Bioenergy Institute, the Joint Genome Institute, and the University of California, Davis. The sponsoring scientists are Dr. Patrick M. Shih and Dr. Ronan C. O?Malley.<br/><br/>Uncovering the inner workings of plants through DNA and RNA sequencing can provide valuable insight on how to better engineer crop plants and is essential in meeting the increasing societal demand for renewable energy and environmental sustainability.  However, these sequencing datasets provide a myriad of analyzable patterns and are often difficult to decipher without sophisticated computational analysis.  The project will develop machine-learning models for plant biology and apply these models directly to develop agricultural biotechnology.  These technologies will assist in enhancing the economic value of crop plants and benefitting society through innovating food, fuel, or chemical production using plants.  The project emphasizes training of the fellow in scientific communication of findings to the general public by creating an interactive website to explore the project findings.  The fellow will engage in mentorship roles to garner interest in scientific careers for local high school and college students of diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop state-of-the-art machine learning models for transcription initiation and chromatin accessibility in both model and crop plant systems in order to redefine core mechanisms of plant gene expression and circumvent the challenges facing engineering plant systems.  The project leverages Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin (ATAC) and Capped Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) sequencing data to train deep convolutional neural networks to predict features important to gene expression in Arabidopsis and tomato. These machine learning models will be utilized for finding open chromatin to facilitate transgenic crop transformation, tunable promoters for transgene expression, and guide the design of de novo DNA parts for synthetic biology in model and crop plant systems.

The Data-to-Design Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (D2D-CURE) network will train and support faculty to broaden research participation and expand high-impact educational practices. The network is designed to make this workflow accessible to a wide array of higher education institutions (community colleges, state schools, liberal arts schools, as well as research universities), as a high-impact module for existing and new biochemistry and bioengineering courses. Collectively and over time students who engage in this project will be generating datasets large enough to begin utilizing machine learning tools to improve protein design algorithms, while learning translatable skills, the process of science, and developing confidence in doing research. This network serves to both train future scientist and to advance the progress of science.<br/><br/>The Data-to-Design Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (D2D-CURE) network's primary goal is to make a well-developed and tested molecular modeling and enzyme characterization workflow accessible to institutions nation-wide as an integratable curricular element for existing and new biology courses. The project has three major activities: The first is the coordination of workshops that will enable instructors from across the country to employ the D2D-CURE workshop at their home institutions. The second is the expansion of an annual conference, currently focused on protein modeling and design, to include a student development and engagement track. Third is the development of an online presence allowing the D2D-CURE participants to work in concert on cutting-edge scientific problems as a community as opposed to isolated institutions and programs. Despite widespread adoption of computational protein design, significant improvements are still needed to move efforts from being a tool used to enrich proteins with the desired function into a more accurate and predictive computer-aided design tool with a quantitative relationship between design and desired function. We plan to focus on enzymes since the only large data sets that currently exist are not quantitative, have a low dynamic range, and often convolve several independent physical measurements into a single value. To generate the data sets needed to develop a new generation of computational protein design software for enzymes, we are proposing a Research Coordination Network to engage students and their instructors in using industrially relevant techniques while generating acutely needed protein structure-function datasets.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Characterizing root exudates and their relationships with other plant traits will improve understanding of plant effects on microbial communities and the ecosystem services that they provide. This project will use laboratory, greenhouse, field, and computational approaches to evaluate the effects of plant root exudates on soil microbial composition and function. The work will be conducted in the context of restored tallgrass American prairies, an endangered ecosystem, and deliver our results directly to land owners and natural resource managers responsible for the creation and maintenance of this landscape. Additionally, the project provides educational opportunities for members of the public ranging from high school students to retired adults and will train early-career scientists in cutting-edge techniques. <br/><br/>This project will develop a predictive, mechanistic framework to understand how phylogenetic and functional characteristics of plants and plant communities influence soil microbial communities and the ecosystem functions via root exudates. It will combine exometabolomic plant measurements, sampling in a biodiversity experiment, functional microbial characterizations, and machine learning approaches to forecast microbial community structure and function in a field setting. Exudate characterizations from a taxonomically and functionally diverse pool of plants will greatly advance knowledge of plant biochemistry. The use of exudates in mesocosm incubation and metabolic characterization experiments will demonstrate their direct impacts on microbial community structure and function.

Why this pattern exists has long been a fundamental question in biology. One possible explanation can be found in the very nature of the way that animals grow from an egg into an adult, i.e., in their development. The genes that control animal development interact in networks. Some genes in these networks interact with many other genes, while others are more peripheral and isolated. This project tests the hypothesis that most evolution in animal form occurs through changes in peripheral network components, and in the aspects of form that those peripheral components make, while central genes and their associated forms are conserved among species. To test this hypothesis, this project investigates the patterns and drivers of tooth evolution in an ecologically diverse animal group, noctilionoid bats. This project is expected to be among the first to characterize the organization of the gene networks that control animal form, and the impact that this organization has on the way evolution proceeds. This project is therefore expected to illuminate mechanisms that have shaped the evolution of animals over the history of life on earth. This project will also directly increase participation of students from underrepresented groups (URMs) in research and contribute to public education. These goals will be achieved by involving URM undergraduates from Puerto Rico in project research, training postdoctoral scientists in URM mentorship, and showcasing project results at the Burke Museum.<br/><br/>This project?s goal is to characterize and model the evolution of developmental GRN modules and resulting morphologies, using the radiation of noctilionoid bats and their molars as a model system. This project's central hypothesis is that a conserved core module of the molar GRN controls the initial formation of molar traits that are conserved across species, with evolutionary modification of network sub-modules leading to interspecific morphological variation. To test this, two aims will be completed. In Aim 1, the team will quantify morphology of developing lower first molars (m1) in representative noctilionoids, and adult m1s across all extant noctilionoid genera. Data will be used to reconstruct the development and evolution of noctilionoid m1 morphology, and identify conserved and variable traits over developmental and evolutionary time. In Aim 2, the team will map gene expression over m1 development in representative noctilionoids, functionally test the ability of observed expression differences in key molar developmental pathways to generate variable m1 morphologies, reconstruct GRN modules for bat m1s in computational space, and link GRN modules to m1 morphological diversity. Using data from both aims, the team will also use machine-learning techniques to reverse-engineer a computational model that will predict m1 phenotypes resulting from variation in developmental modules. Through this research, this project will characterize the role of developmental biases in morphological evolution within an adaptive radiation, functionally link shifts in gene expression to the evolution of morphology among closely related species, and generate a predictive model for morphological evolution across a hyper-diverse mammal group<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research supported through this RAPID award uncovers new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses mimic human biology to facilitate infection and adaptation strategies. Previous research has revealed that host mimicry is essential for viral infection mechanisms yet currently there is a deficiency of tools to comprehensively identify and classify ?signatures? of host mimicry in viral sequence data. Identifying and classifying these sequence signatures (motifs) enable researchers to more accurately predict host targets based on viral adaptation strategies that underly the transmission and spread of COVID-19. This project delivers new data on human mimicry by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and open-source algorithms with supporting information to the scientific community through web-based resources. Discoveries from this project have potential use to guide the development of novel treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. This project also offers a training opportunity for an undergraduate student in systems virology.<br/><br/>A growing body of literature documents how viruses mimic host motifs to hijack cells, particularly through evasion of host immune functions. Motifs are small in size (3-10 amino acids in disordered proteins or regions) and hence require only a limited number of mutations for rapidly evolving viruses to acquire host motifs. Against this backdrop, this project is designed to develop a viral classification system based on motifs to identify host mimicry elements in SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. The project then infers target host pathways used in viral mechanisms that are illustrated in a use case. Curation of existing data from viral sequence databases, newly published sequences, along with the collection of motif types from the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource, provides training data for machine-learning (ML) algorithm development. The algorithm in turn provides a classifier that i) makes predictions of host motifs in viruses, ii) defines enrichment and co-occurrence of motif types, iii) defines association of motifs with structured and disordered viral protein domains, and iv) predicts host targets and pathways. In the use case, evaluation of precision and recall against selected viruses with known mechanisms of action, supported by a knowledge base of experimental evidence, provides a test of the classification method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will generate understanding of physiologically relevant cell migration behaviors, which are responsible for orchestrating the formation of multicellular organisms. Because cells interact directly and constantly with their surroundings to create movement, migration is context dependent. However, cell motility has historically been studied in two-dimensional (2D) environments. The Principal Investigator (PI) discovered that cells display different migration behaviors in 3D environments that are more physiological. This project will address the fundamental question: How do 3D environmental cues give rise to distinct migration behaviors? The PI will employ a new process for creating 3D environments, a new integrated microscopic imaging technique and advanced computational biology approaches to develop a predictive, quantitative model of how cells move in three dimensions through a synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM). Such a model has the potential to advance our basic understanding of cell motility, which is a critical aspect of eukaryotic development.  The project will additionally provide research training opportunities for graduate students and experience-based educational projects on multi-scale systems analysis and career education for high school and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>In 3D spaces like bodily tissues, it is generally accepted that the coordination of four local processes (adhesion, cytoskeletal polymerization, contractility, and matrix remodeling) dictate global motility behaviors. Yet, no quantitative framework has been developed to link these localized processes to global cell behaviors. Such a framework would represent a generalized platform for both studying and engineering cell motility, where any signal input (chemical exciter/inhibitor, physical cue, etc.) could be quantified by its effect on these processes to predict the resulting motility behavior output. Historically, motility models have been formulated using a bottom-up approach, where theoretical physical and kinetic equations are fitted to observations. These approaches have advanced the understanding of local processes of motility on 2D planar surfaces. However, mathematical, computational, and experimental limitations have prevented their full extension to physiologically relevant 3D cell motility. The top-down approach used in this project overcomes current limitations to immediately address a fundamental question: How can subcellular molecular processes be connected with the geometry and translocation of the whole cell in a 3D ECM? The goal of this project is to integrate knowledge across three scales of cell motility, extracellular, sub-cellular, and cellular, by taking a data-driven systems approach. In Aim 1, the PI will develop a microfluidic device that will enable highly controlled, systematic variation of ECM matrix properties and high-throughput analysis of their regulatory role in cell migration. Aim 2 will combine into a single platform a time-lapse cell tracking assay and quantitative molecular imaging techniques, which the PI previously developed for measuring the four core motility processes within cells in a 3D ECM. This platform will allow the analysis of single-cell motility at an integrated systems level for the first time. In Aim 3, the PI will apply machine learning and statistical modeling techniques to the single-cell data generated in Aim 2 to develop a predictive framework for emergent 3D cell motility."

This project will achieve the same for applications that use videos to track movement of animals, cells, or robots, by producing freely available software for efficient and automatic extraction of movement data and directly adding such data to a public database (the KNB Data Repository). The software will be easy to use and adapt to new types of videos, issues that have so far been roadblocks to widespread adoption of existing video tracking tools. The ability to share both movement data and videos will stimulate collaboration among researchers. Both functionalities will enable fundamentally new advances in such areas as animal group behavior, behavioral genetics, cell biology, and collective robotics, and other fields that record the movements of many individuals. The software, because of its ease of use and enabled access to research videos from the database, will also serve as a tool in teaching at the K-12 and college level. In addition, this project will serve to train several college and graduate students in both biology and computer science; such interdisciplinary training is essential for advances in biological research today.<br/><br/>This project will implement a unique combination of clear, current graphical user interface design to improve usability with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to improve movement tracking accuracy. In addition, the developed software will enable users to visualize results for validation and analysis, and include functionality for users to correct any remaining tracking errors. This will enable users to get scientific-quality data output without having to employ multiple software applications and without having to manually post-process data files. In the context of the project, several workshops will be held and a website developed to improve accessibility for students and researchers in biology. The project will also develop a direct link to the existing KNB scientific data repository, such that users can access the repository, compare their results, or complete meta-analyses easily. Besides advancing biological research, this will also generate an extensive resource for computer vision scientists by providing a large collection of videos with accurate user annotation for improving core algorithms such as object detection and tracking.

Surmounting significant challenges such as the ability of infectious agents to evolve resistance to drugs and the ability of crop pests to defeat a diverse array of increasingly powerful insecticides requires an understanding of the nature of adaptation. Recent advances have demonstrated that adaptation often occurs via ""soft selective sweeps,"" in which an adaptive genetic variant originates multiple times or has become favored only after it has been present at a substantial frequency in the population. This project contributes to advancing knowledge of the fundamental evolutionary process of adaptation by developing new computational tools to detect and study the occurrence of adaptation by soft selective sweeps. Through the interactions of a multidisciplinary team spanning evolutionary biology and bioinformatics, the project integrates advances in evolutionary simulation with modern and efficient computational methods in order to produce progress on understanding adaptation, while simultaneously developing efficient computational tools applicable in the modern ""big-data"" era of inexpensive sequencing. In addition, its joint mentorship efforts from evolutionary and bioinformatics perspectives promote interdisciplinary training of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. <br/><br/>The project has four objectives: (1) To design new tests for detecting selection in the case in which soft selective sweeps occur from standing genetic variation; (2) To identify haplotypes that carry a beneficial allele in genomic regions known to be experiencing positive selection; (3) To enhance new methods of analysis of natural selection to make them robust to confounding demographic scenarios; (4) To apply new selection methods in a series of data sets from multiple species, including humans, Drosophila, and Plasmodium malaria parasites. The project will use algorithmic techniques from combinatorial optimization and machine learning, and it will exploit ideas from population genetics and coalescent theory. It breaks ground on several fronts, providing a deeper understanding of the patterns in site-frequency spectra and haplotype data as a basis for selection signatures, and assisting in the design of subtyping studies for complex regions of the genome. As it becomes increasingly possible to sequence whole genomes of multiple individuals within a population, the intellectual challenge of designing tools for detecting selection to accommodate new phenomena such as soft sweeps coincides with the computational challenge of incorporating genomic data sets into selection studies. These challenges are addressed by the project, whose results will be available at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/vbafna/research-2/nsf1458059/."

Ideally new experiments include some replication, fill in gaps and produce new knowledge, but this balance is hard to achieve when existing data sets are in different locations or organized in very different ways.  Thus to achieve the goal, two aims are proposed: 1) develop methods for creating cohesive biological datasets from public experiments such that they are suitable for training computational models; 2) develop methods that indicate what experimental conditions should be used to collect new datasets so that are the most likely to yield important information about the study organism's biological properties, like structure and behavior. Achieving this goal will enable an understanding of important rules of life for organisms more efficiently and economically, by focusing on the experiments that give us the most value for the funds spent.<br/><br/>This exploratory project will focus on data arising from genome-wide transcriptional profiling methods (e.g. microarrays, RNA-Seq), building a computational foundation for later expansion. First, optimal data processing techniques for creating integrated compendia will be assessed, in order to select the best method for building training datasets for machine learning methods. Second, data-driven computational models will be trained on the data compendia and evaluated for success in describing and microbial behavior. Third, given the normalized compendia (in the transcriptomics data space) an optimal experimental design methodology will be prototyped, to recommend the best set of experiments to perform to yield the complete set of data needed to fit and test the biological model. The experimental design methodology will be benchmarked using synthetic data, and then evaluated by exploring the effect of design- recommended combinations of antibiotics and antiseptics (10 in all) on microbial behavior. This will be compared to the outcomes of experiments designed by methods currently used. Success metrics will focus on how quickly the required information in the experimental space is gathered and what level of uncertainty in a model remains after each experiment is completed."

At lower frequency, similar variants called sports arise during normal growth. These new variants can have great economic value, but relatively little is known of the causes, nature and evolutionary significance of these phenomena. This project will investigate these changes in potato. The methods suitable to analyze these genomic changes will be applicable to other crops, and will be made available to the scientific and plant breeding community.  Societal impact is expected along two lines. First, this project will address a largely ignored potential source of variation likely to affect leading economic species. Second, the project entails several outreach activities, with two objectives: 1) Familiarize young students in underrepresented communities with science studies and careers and 2) Train advanced students and professionals in genomic approaches applicable to plant breeding. These objectives will be achieved through a combination of publishing in outreach journals, provision of international workshops, and production of learning videos.<br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms and outcomes of genome instability and restructuring. The central hypothesis is that instability, while often deleterious, can also reshape the genome in ways that are less disruptive and potentially adaptive, such as by causing change or loss of heterozygosity, and dosage variation. Elucidating the causes, mechanisms, and consequences of these changes will help clarify their role in natural and artificial selection, and inform prediction, identification and, if appropriate, exploitation of these changes. The work will focus on the autotetraploid potato genome, in which we have documented extensive genomic changes in tissue culture regenerated potatoes, ranging from aneuploidy to indels, extreme rearrangements, but also more subtle changes in heterozygosity consistent with homologous DNA repair. Analysis of variation in potato suggests that genome instability varies according to environment and that it can occur during normal growth. The specific aims are to: i) Characterize the molecular patterns associated with somaclonal variation in potato. By examining resulting rearrangements, hypotheses on potential mechanisms, such as homologous vs. nonhomologous repair of dsDNA breaks, will be tested, ii) Study molecular patterns associated with differentiation of potato clones. Genomic analysis of clonally propagated potato will test the hypothesis that somatic homologous recombination results in variation and, iii) Investigate relation of dsDNA breaks to loss of heterozygosity. This objective will leverage induced and spontaneous loss of heterozygosity models to test possible mechanisms of dsDNA break repair, such as mitotic crossover and break-induced recombination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This scientific instrument will prepare biology majors for careers in the biological sciences and enhance educational opportunities for students at the undergraduate and Master's level by being utilized in multiple lower- and upper-division classes, advanced research-focused classes, and for individual student research projects outside of the classroom. Importantly, the FACS will catalyze an interdisciplinary effort between scientific departments, improving the educational experience of biology, chemistry, and computer science students by allowing authentic research projects for students to collaborate on. These collaborations are essential; the ability to work together as an interdisciplinary team to solve complex problems is an essential aspect of modern research that many students do not have adequate exposure to. Additionally, acquisition of a FACS machine will establish CSU Chico, a Hispanic- serving public university with a service area that spans 21% of rural California, as a leading undergraduate institution in Northern California for immunology, chemical biology, and bioinformatics. Allowing our diverse student population with different scientific backgrounds to perform interdisciplinary research activities with their peers will build their enthusiasm for research, encouraging students from this traditionally underserved rural population to pursue further studies that combine these research fields.

Dealing with this data avalanche poses a special challenge for research that probes the structure and function of brain circuits and systems with techniques such as large scale high resolution light microscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and high density recording of brain electrical activity. The aim of this collaborative project between the University of California San Diego and Yale University is to catalyze such research by enhancing the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG), an existing cyberinfrastructure resource that was originally developed to facilitate projects that need High Performance Computing, such as large scale computational modeling of brain circuits. The current project will enhance NSG by incorporating innovations in high throughput computing (HTC) and data management that are required for research involving large amounts of data, implemented in ways that reduce or eliminate the technical and administrative challenges faced by scientists who need to deal with such data. In addition to enabling data-intensive neuroscience research, these new capabilities will increase NSG's utility in education, where it is already widely used in neuroscience and biology instruction at the undergraduate level and higher. Webinars, workshops, and training classes at various conferences will be presented to students and researchers to learn about NSG's new capabilities. This project will increase NSG's scientific and social value as an open and free resource that democratizes participation in science by enabling access to computing and data resources for students and researchers at all academic institutions. <br/><br/>This project adds HTC features to NSG that have been judged most suitable to meet the large scale computing needs for neuroscience data processing, based on actual and projected use cases provided by neuroscientists engaged in data-intensive research. It incorporates commercial cloud computing and Open Science Grid (OSG) resources, integrating them with NSG?s ability to submit appropriate compute workloads to these HTC resources while maintaining the ease of use features of NSG that allow users to seamlessly exploit these compute resources,. Many of the tools that utilize HTC computing mode are made available via NSG to allow processing of input data and retrieval of output results within the existing web based and programmatic user environment of NSG. Flexibility is also provided for users to directly use containerized images of neuroscience modeling and data processing tools on commercial cloud computing resources. Integration of OSG?s data federation capability allows processing of publicly available large neuroscience data which can be distributed in a scalable manner to HTC resources. Incorporation of various data functionalities such as the ability to transfer large data directly to NSG?s storage, share data among NSG users, access and process data by multiple NSG users, enable researchers to perform a wide diversity of data-driven neuroscience research be it processing of electrophysiological (electroencephalography i.e. EEG, magnetoencephalography i.e. MEG), imaging (fMRI) or behavioral (reaction time, test accuracy) data, correlational analysis of multimodal data, or application of machine/deep learning.

The label is a small protein called ubiquitin (Ub), which is attached to the condemned protein to target it to the proteasome where it is degraded. The cellular machines (E3 ligases) that are responsible for tagging proteins with Ub are very large, nearly 300 kilodaltons in size, and they contain eight to ten protein subunits that all work together to put the Ub tag on the condemned protein. These machines function in all higher life forms, so it is essential to understand how they work. Structural and dynamic experiments will explore the mechanism of how these machines work in vitro using an assembled, purified, active machine. Two graduate students will work full-time on the project, and they will learn both protein biochemistry and biophysical experimental methods. High school students will work in the lab during the summer months. The high school students, some of whom are from disadvantaged backgrounds, will gain knowledge of cutting edge mass spectrometry methods used to understand protein dynamics.<br/>  <br/>The project focuses on ASB-CUL5-RING E3s (ASB-CRL), a large class of E3 ligases. They consist of one of 18 Ankyrin and SOCS box proteins (ASBs) as substrate receptors, elongins B and C (ELOB/C), cullin 5 (CUL5), and the E2-binding protein (RBX2). Each ASB binds 10-15 substrates. No structures are available for ASB-CRLs. The project aims to understand the structure, dynamics, and function of the ASB9-CRL. Thus far, full-length ASB9-CRL has been purified following strategic co-expression in E. coli. The purified complex is active in vitro and ubiquitylation of two substrates, creatine kinase (CK) and histone octamers has been demonstrated. Structural models of CRLs predict a distance of over 60 angstroms between Ub and the substrate, and it remains unknown how Ub is transferred across such a long distance. Additionally, neddylation has been shown to regulate the ubiquitylation activity of CRLs. In the first part of the project, ubiquitylation assays will be used to quantitatively compare the rate of Ub-transfer to CK and to histone octamers by the neddylated and un-neddylated ligase. The Ub attachment sites and extent of poly-ubiquitylation will be measured. In the second part of the project, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) will be used to probe the internal and global conformational dynamics that drive the long distance conformational changes required for Ub transfer by the ASB9-CRL. In the third part of the project, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) will be used to obtain high-resolution structures of the full ASB-CRL complex and important sub-complexes.

In order for information in DNA to be used in the cell, the DNA is first copied into an intermediate sister molecule called RNA which is then decoded into protein sequence. However, in order to be useful, internal parts of the RNA must first be removed and the surrounding sequences precisely pasted together by a process called RNA splicing. Splicing is a carried out by one of the largest and most complicated machines in the cell, the spliceosome, which consists of over 100 proteins and 5 RNA molecules that assemble onto the RNA at the region to be spliced out. Because of the complexity of assembling such a large machine onto the RNA, there is still much to learn about the mechanisms by which the spliceosome accurately chooses the sites in the RNA that will be spliced together. Genetic experiments to search for mutations that affect splice site choice are an important and cutting-edge component of this research, and these experiments will be carried out by minority undergraduate participants in an established summer undergraduate training program at the University of California-Santa Cruz (UCSC). This training will be important in preparing these students for positions in UCSC faculty research labs, and for future admission into PhD programs.<br/><br/>This project employs the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to explore pre-mRNA splicing through integrated genetic, genomic and biochemical approaches. Unique approaches have been developed in the preliminary studies that uncovered new regulatory phenomena for splice site selection at both ends of the region of RNA to be removed, called the 5' and 3' splice sites. Genetic screens have been used to uncover new roles for factors important for the regulation of 5' splice site choice. Fundamental differences have been uncovered in alternative adjacent 3' splice site selection between somatic and germ cells. The research will expand on these observations by addressing the following two questions: how do protein factors regulate the choice of 5' splice sites, and what are the mechanistic differences in 3' splice site selection between soma and germ cells?  The results are expected to provide novel insights into how the splicing machinery accurately chooses the 5' and 3' splice sites."

An organism?s DNA can be separated into two categories: coding DNA, which has the directions for how to build proteins ? the molecular machines of the cell, and non-coding DNA, which has many functions including the instructions for when, where, and how much protein should be built. The majority of the human genome is non-coding DNA, and its proper functioning is essential for life. This project aims to decipher some of the rules that govern function of non-coding DNA in the innate immune response to infection and to compare these rules to non-coding DNA needed for other biological processes. Success will give scientists specific information about how non-coding DNA orchestrates the immune response and a deeper understanding about how a large part of the genome functions in general. Both graduate and undergraduate students will participate and be trained in the work. This project also includes a broader impacts plan to improve quantitative literacy among biology undergraduate and graduate students, which will better equip them for modern jobs that increasingly require quantitative skills.<br/><br/>Virtually every biological process, from development to immunity, is controlled by a gene regulatory network (GRN), a network of signaling molecules and transcription factors that control gene expression. Years of work have uncovered how the sequence of regulatory DNA, e.g. promoters and enhancers, can specify a GRN?s function. This work largely has focused on developmental GRNs, which are uniquely constrained by evolution: selection favors GRNs that drive a stereotyped developmental program in spite of perturbations. To decipher which principles of developmental GRNs translate to lesser studied non-developmental GRNs, which have diverse functions and are subject to different evolutionary pressures, this project will study the Drosophila innate immunity GRN. In Aim 1, allele-specific RNA-seq will be used to characterize the natural variation in transcriptional response to infection between D. melanogaster lines. These data will allow the identification of genes whose expression variation is driven by changes in regulatory DNA. Comparisons of the pattern of expression variation using different infection conditions will be made. In Aim 2, in vivo and in vitro functional genomics assays will be used to identify immune-responsive enhancers and to generate sequence-to-function models of these enhancers. Additional experiments will validate and refine the models of enhancer function. The project also includes a plan to implement problem-based learning of numerical literacy components into a large, undergraduate class, which will improve the quantitive skills of biology students and be disseminated for use by others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex behavioral sequences are assembled from simpler motor programs.  Like nest-building in birds and web-spinning in spiders, grooming in flies represents a flexible, innate, adaptive motor sequence.  This project will use the genetic tools available in flies, combined with new machine vision analysis, to identify the neurons that control fly grooming behavior.  It will focus on the connections between the brain and the ventral nervous system, since these descending neurons are a natural information bottleneck.  Understanding how a limited number of neurons convey commands and coordinate competing reflexes into productive behaviors will advance basic knowledge in neuroscience and provide conceptual insights into how any brain ? including human ones ? solve similar challenges.  One focus of the NSF's mission to promote basic science research is to understand the rules of life, and specifically to predict phenotypes.  This research contributes to ongoing efforts to generate maps of all the neurons and their connections in the fly by adding information about their behavioral functions. As part of the educational objectives of this project, the PI will organize a summer course at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics for experimentalists and theorists that will involve both cutting edge topics in modern systems neuroscience and theoretical approaches. Specific efforts will be made to recruit undergraduate students to this quantitative biology summer course. <br/><br/>This research will employ automated behavioral analysis of Drosophila grooming, optogenetic manipulations, and anatomical characterization of neuronal circuits.  Screens using new genetic reagents to target specific descending neurons will delineate their behavioral roles.  The project will characterize the projections and connections of these neurons to determine how they interface with sensory and motor circuits.  Activating combinations of descending neurons that initiate competing behavioral programs will reveal whether decisions are made in the brain or the ventral nerve cord.  Neural circuits that can be mapped in the fly represent fundamental motifs that perform computations common to all brains.  Understanding their roles in grooming behavior uses the advantages of this model to learn how the brain achieves motor sequences.

Immediate goals are to develop artificial cytoskeletons to allow control of cell shape and organization upon command, offering insights into basic cellular processes. This project also examines societal impacts to inform the team's researchers and to help prepare public presentations to increase broader impacts. This work should spark public discussion on the role of hybrid organisms in society and will examine public concerns of producing something 'unnatural.'

The project focuses on developing two types of artificial cytoskeletons (synCyto) that can be introduced into living cells and controlled experimentally, based on: 1) Spirostomum myonemes and (2) Magnetic particles (Magnetic Robotic Swarms). The prediction is that these will form dynamic assemblages inside of cells that can be controllable experimentally through inputs such as light or magnetic fields to change cell shape and move other organelles. This work provides proof of principle towards developing hybrid cells with multiple synthetic organelles.

This project contributes to understanding of life cycle variation in insects, how such flexibility mediates ecological processes at the landscape scale, and what factors interact to influence perenniality. The research will help inform predictions as to how impacts of species invasions may respond to climate change. Furthermore, this project will provide insights into transmission of common diseases of wasps and their bee prey. As yellowjackets can be public nuisances, revealing the causes of perenniality may lead to the development of control methods that prevent the emergence of perenniality in this species and potentially in other species. In addition to providing research opportunities for undergraduates, the researchers will develop an educational activity on invasive social insects for K-6 children about the biology and potential hazards posed by social wasps.<br/><br/>This project focuses on invasive social wasps that have structural effects on the ecosystems that they invade. These wasps express plasticity in key life history traits (e.g. annual or perennial colony phenology), which greatly magnifies their ecological impacts. The researchers explicitly test how ecological and climatic factors interact to affect shifts in invader life history traits and ultimately modify invasion impacts. Specifically this research investigates how yellowjacket foraging behavior and colony phenology shift in response to diet subsidies, artificial warming of the nest to simulate mild climate, or both subsidies and artificial warming. Coupling such manipulations with landscape-scale prey population sampling, this project also quantifies subsequent invasion impacts on native prey. These experiments will provide insights as to how yellowjackets may respond to changes in pollinator populations and climate change. Furthermore, researchers will determine whether wasp consumption of honey bees influences pathogen load; this is particularly important as honey bee pathogens are increasingly detected in non-honey bee species. Pathogen screening will help distinguish whether (a) wasps increase their pathogen load by consuming bees, (b) whether wasps transmit pathogens through predation and raiding of beehives, and (c) identify differences in pathology between annual and perennial colonies. Understanding the factors affecting life history is vital for predicting how trait evolution or plasticity may respond to future global climate change."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. Plant-microbe associations impact plant phenotype, distribution and biodiversity and range in their effects on a spectrum from costly parasitic to beneficial mutualistic interactions. The relationship between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants is especially important ecologically because these bacteria are able to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into plant-available ammonia (NH3). The Fellow aims to understand how microbes help plants access nitrogen in extreme soil environments like serpentine soil. These soils are naturally high in heavy metals and low in essential plant nutrients. The project will use a serpentine ecosystem to explore the relative influence of soil chemistry and plant type on beneficial plant-microbe associations and plant development. This research is important because it can help society preserve the biodiversity it knows and loves and improve food production by decreasing reliance on artificial fertilizers. In addition to the research, the Fellow proposes to broaden participation in biology by preparing a diverse STEM workforce and integrating research with education.

Their diversity is staggering, with more than 500,000 species thought to exist. These minute wasps (mostly 1-2 mm in size) are numerically abundant and common in almost every habitat. The smallest of these wasps are smaller than a typical single-celled organism, and yet the adults can fly, locate their hosts, deposit their eggs, and as larvae, consume their insect hosts. Most chalcidoid wasps are parasitoids; they feed on their insect hosts, eventually killing them. A few groups have also evolved to attack plant hosts and some serve as pollinators. Species attack all life stages from eggs to adults, and live and feed either internally or externally. Some are parasitoids of other parasitoids and some may even feed on their own species. Because they kill other insects, these wasps are extremely important for the control of pests of agricultural and forest crops, as well as vectors of human disease and veterinary pests. The economic importance of these wasps in pest management is unparalleled. They are widely used in biological control programs against major pests, with outcomes documented to result in decreases in pesticide, increases in yield, and in landmark cases direct savings of billions of dollars or permanent pest control. The evolutionary events leading to this enormous diversity in morphology, biology and rates of diversification are poorly understood, leading to an artificial system of taxonomic classification. In this research project, researchers will use a diverse array of molecular, morphological and bioinformatics approaches to develop a solid understanding of the hierarchy of relationships across the entire group. These relationships will then be used to reclassify major groups to reflect common ancestry, to provide a framework for a web-accessible portal to manage and deliver information on their diverse biology, and to explore the evolutionary changes that have driven and shaped this enormous radiation of terrestrial insects.<br/><br/>The objectives of the research project are to 1) generate a robust molecular phylogeny of the Chalcidoidea using new data from transcriptomes and targeted DNA enrichment for over 400 species, 2) generate morphological data for over 200 fossils from Eocene and Cretaceous amber and combine these with a comprehensive morphological data set for extant taxa, 3) develop a revised classification of Chalcidoidea in book form through a series of workshops and worldwide collaborations, and 4) make available information on the taxonomy, biology and distribution of over 31,000 available names and information in over 40,000 references. The project will train two postdoctoral researchers, one graduate student and several undergraduates. To involve the wider scientific community, a worldwide group of biocontrol researchers and taxonomists will develop a new classification for Chalcidoidea.

Although the acoustic environment -- what animals hear -- may be important to many species, it remains largely unexplored as a force influencing where animals can be found. This project will examine the extent to which natural sounds, such as those generated by wind and water, influence where animals settle, how they interact with one another and, ultimately, how they structure entire communities. Focusing on birds and bats, the investigators will conduct a large-scale experiment in which they place many speakers in the forest to create ""phantom"" oceans and rivers -- the sounds of moving water without the water itself.  This will allow them to figure out how sounds can change the way in which species interact with their environment and with each other. Specifically, this study will test how noise can explain where animals live, how they behave, and the extent to which they are impacted by human-made noise generated, for example, along major highways. This study will also provide research opportunities for undergraduate students at small universities and will result in an ""Acoustics in Ecology and Evolution"" workshop to teach young scientists how to incorporate acoustics into their own ecological field research.<br/><br/>Researchers will test for acoustic impacts on bird and bat communities in areas characterized by high levels of natural sounds from moving water (natural river and ocean surf sounds), low levels of natural sounds, high levels of artificially created natural sounds (phantom river and surf sounds), and spectrally-shifted, artificially created natural sounds.  The latter two treatments will be generated via large-scale playbacks of sounds recorded elsewhere. The experimental approach of playing back natural sounds at different frequencies will allow researchers to parse the influence of acoustic masking versus more general effects of sounds (e.g., disturbance and distraction) on bird and bat behavior and on community structure.  Researchers will also assess the potential role of low frequency natural sounds as acoustic beacons for habitat selection. Field work will entail a combination of behavioral experiments, bird, bat, arthropod and vegetation surveys, and spatially explicit quantification of the acoustic environment.  Researchers will test hypotheses regarding how sounds structure communities directly by masking cues used for communication or predator/prey detection, directly via elevated perceived risk through a reduction in auditory surveillance, or indirectly by altering prey distributions."

Most studies of biological responses to environmental change have either documented the natural pattern of whole-species response to past change or, alternatively, the effects of experimentally manipulated environment on the performance of a few individuals. The former approach benefits from its realism, but is too coarse to elucidate the physiological responses underlying the response to changes in climate. The latter approach demonstrates these mechanisms in detail, but does so at small spatial scales and under artificially simplified experimental conditions. This study seeks to bridge these two approaches, studying the responses of the plant Valeriana edulis to climatic variation at field sites in the Colorado Rockies. Individuals of this species have separate sexes (i.e. are either male or female) and the sexes respond differently to changes in climate.  The researchers will investigate how these variable, individual-level responses to climate scale up to determine population dynamics and species persistence. This work will be conducted at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) using historic and contemporary demographic data to compare the effects of a changing climate over space (an 1800 m elevational gradient), between experimental manipulations (warming and snow removal), and over time (40 year record).  This study also provides opportunities for education and outreach through undergraduate and graduate scientific training, citizen science initiatives, and through the development of web-based curricula in collaboration with the RMBL.<br/><br/>This research asks whether the sex-mediated physiological response of males and females in dioecious species to changes in climate can skew population structure (sex ratios) with resultant demographic consequences. The researchers will construct size- and sex-structured demographic models using historic and contemporary data on vital rates, mating functions, water use efficiency and primary (seed) sex ratio for populations under (1) historic climate, (2) contemporary climate over the species' elevation range, and (3) experimental warming and snow removal. Using model selection and life table response experiment analyses, this study assesses the overall consequences of spatial (1800 m elevation), temporal (past vs. present) and manipulated (present vs. simulated future) variation in climate for population performance, as well as the specific contribution of (and physiological basis to) climate-skewed sex ratios."

This investigation will join the oceanographic cruises of two major field campaigns in the North Atlantic Ocean. The results will be integrated using several computational approaches to interpret variations in microbial community structure, the role of biochemical, genomic and taxonomic diversity in maintaining biodiversity patterns of today's oceans, as well as potential future oceans, and microbial networks.

Understanding how proteins function is one of the most exciting frontiers of science, and is necessary in order to address societal needs in fields as diverse as renewable energy and agriculture.  The rich and intricate 3-dimensional shapes of more than 100,000 different kinds of proteins are now documented, thanks to revolutionary advances in X-ray spectroscopy, magnetic resonance, and other methods.  However, while knowing the shape of a machine, for example, seeing a photograph of a sewing machine, might give one a clue as to how it works, a movie of a machine in action is far more revealing.  The goal of this project is to develop new methods to make such ""movies"" of proteins, or stated more precisely, to develop methods to measure the time resolved conformational changes in protein structure (or structural dynamics).  A team of graduate students and undergraduates, working at the interface between physics, chemistry, and biology, and working closely with international collaborators, will tackle this exciting problem, and will emerge well-positioned to become leaders in the nation's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce.<br/><br/>""Filming"" proteins in action requires a calibrated tool to measure distances of several nanometers with high throughput and, ideally, sub-millisecond time resolution.  This tool must be compatible with the complex local environments in which proteins perform their functions; ideally, in aqueous solutions although many proteins continue to function as long as they are above about 215K.  The primary goal of the proposed research is to use high-frequency (>200 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) combined with site-directed spin labeling with spin-7/2 Gd3+ moieties to measure time-resolved conformational changes of proteins.  With prior NSF support, the PI and co-PI's collaboration has demonstrated that the simplest possible 240 GHz EPR measurements; measurements of the lineshapes of molecules containing a pair of Gd3+ spin labels; is capable of resolving distances greater than 3 nm even at room temperature.   The proposed research will build on these key developments, focusing primarily on time-resolved distance measurements in the model protein Proteorhodopsin (PR), a photosynthetic trans-membrane proton pump that can be triggered with flashes of light to begin synchronized cascades of conformational changes on time scales ranging from less than 1 microsecond to more than 1 second. The main activities undertaken will be: (1) Developing a simple method based on measuring the lineshape of the Gd3+ EPR line to extract distances and distance distributions in the 1.5-4 nm range from PR doubly labeled with Gd3+.  (2) Measuring conformational changes of PR at temperatures ranging from about 215K (where PR is frozen but active) to room temperature with sub-millisecond time resolution. (3) Pulsed EPR studies of Gd3+ to understand the spin physics of Gd3+ at very high frequencies."

The Center will 1) develop the practical and computational tools to predict, design and experimentally test the impact on cellular function of designed changes in the internal organization of cells, 2) create the experimental tools for building multicellular and multi-organism structures, and 3) develop living ""bioreactors"" that will generate products of commercial value. To achieve this vision, integration is required at many levels. Scientists trained in cell biology, physics, engineering, mathematics and computer science will work together, and practical scientists who experiment in the laboratory will work together with computer modelers and theoreticians. In order to develop cellular machines with real-world applications, university researchers will work with their counterparts in commercial companies, and to train a new generation of researchers at undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels in this emerging field, institutions with strong undergraduate programs will work together with research intensive universities and industrial partners to develop new interdisciplinary courses and training methods. The Center will take advantage of ""incubator space"" at the University of California-San Francisco to encourage the formation of start-up companies.  Partnered with UC-San Francisco in this Center are San Francisco State University, UC-Berkeley, Stanford University, IBM Almaden, and the San Francisco Exploratorium. Education and Human Resource Development (including an emphasis on increasing diversity) will be integrated into the Center through multiple activities; high school students and teachers from San Francisco Unified School District and across the Bay Area will be recruited to participate in summer instructional ""Boot Camp"" experiences, and 10-20 undergraduate research internships will be offered to students (especially under-represented minorities) from San Francisco State University, City College of San Francisco, and UC Santa Cruz. Public engagement with Center activities will involve Science Festivals, Maker Faires, Hackathons and (through partnership with the Exploratorium) Science Museum Exhibits.<br/> <br/>The Center will focus on five projects, from basic research to real-world applications, integrated to permit the Center to implement iterative ""design-build-test"" cycles of living cellular machines. The first project, a Cellular Machine Shop/Core, will create an inventory of high throughput and modular tools for cell engineering that will enable the ""build"" step of the engineering ""design, build, test"" cycle. A set of core resources and instruments for the Center community will be assembled, including high throughput and quantitative imaging systems, gene synthesis, and next generation sequencing. These will be used to assemble modules for cellular engineering in other Center projects.  The second project, Computer Aided Design, will generate tools to implement a computational ""design"" platform for engineering cells with predictable and desired internal structure, as well as to design multi-cellular structures. The third project will create the molecular tools necessary to program multiple specialized cell types or organisms into multicellular structures capable of executing complex functions. The fourth project ""Living Bioreactor"" will specify the organization of intracellular and multi-cellular structures to implement new approaches to metabolic engineering by tuning organelle size to improve yield, and by creating multi-layered self-assembling/self-healing multi-kingdom cell aggregates capable of withstanding harsh conditions, resisting contamination, and facilitating harvesting of the desired products. The fifth project ""Cell State Inference Engine"" will create a software platform for converting images of cells into estimates of cell environment and signaling state, permitting e.g. the use of cells as living sensors of environmental conditions for real-world applications, and also providing a framework for predicting how cells transition between phenotypic states, one of the great challenges in cell biology"

How and why do complex organs, like eyes, evolve?  These phenomena happen on time scales much longer than our lives, making it difficult for us to understand how they happened.  Species are defined by being distinct from and not breeding with each other.  Not interbreeding could be a simple matter of when, where or who you choose to mate with.  It could also be caused by a failure to produce offspring that can survive and reproduce.  Species today are often kept separate from one another by multiple mechanisms, so we do not know how they evolved in the first place.  Likewise, complex organs are like machines with many parts that must all be present and well integrated if the machine is to work, but how did this complexity arise?  In each case, nature most often presents us with end products without any clues about how they came about; however, sometimes nature provides groups of species that retain enough clues to these processes for one to be able to study how they occur, as in the case of this research program.   One impact of this work pertains to the complex organ that is studied.  These investigators are studying the evolution of placentas and are doing so in a context in which they can compare species with placentas with close relatives who lack placentas or have less complex placentas.  This diversity enables them to address the consequences of having a placenta, including how it affects fertility. The research will enhance the training of students at multiple levels (high school, college, and post-graduate) as well as provide outreach to the public.<br/><br/>The proposed research combines work done at two levels of resolution. First, the investigators will work on all species in the fish family Poeciliidae, enabling them to define the timing and order of evolutionary changes.   Second, they will perform experiments on individual species within the family to characterize the mechanisms that cause evolution. They will sequence whole genomes then use the DNA sequences to reconstruct the family tree.  They will characterize the biology of every species on the tree, including how females provision their young and how males and females choose who to mate with.  These fish all bear live young, but some fully provision eggs before they are fertilized while others continue to provision eggs after fertilization.  The latter group has the functional equivalent of a mammalian placenta, but species vary in how well the placenta is developed and how much they provision young during development.  Species also differ in how they choose mates, with some having males with elaborate ornamentation and courtship displays and others with no sex differences in coloration and no courtship.  The integration of biology with the family tree is what will enable the investigators to infer when and in what order female provisioning and aspects of mate choice evolved.  It is also possible to test whether the evolution of certain traits is associated with an acceleration or deceleration of how fast new species are formed.  It will then be possible to test predictions derived from evolutionary theory for how the evolution of these traits are inter-related with one another.  The family tree also enables the investigators to identify closely related species that differ in the presence or absence of placentas.  These species pairs become the subjects of experiments in which they will perform more detailed studies of the biology of reproductive isolation, including assessments of multiple mating and the rate of evolution of reproductive isolation.  The integration of work done at both levels will enable the investigators to detail how mating systems and mode of reproduction affect the evolution of reproductive isolation, how these different facets of speciation have interacted to shape the evolution of species in the family and how they affect the rate of speciation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal integrates experimental and computational approaches in a synergistic fashion to address these gaps in knowledge. Many enzymes with uncharacterized roles in cell division were recently uncovered in a proteomic screen to identify novel mitotic microtubule associated proteins.  Genetic screens confirmed the importance of these proteins for cell division.  These were termed novel cell division proteins (NCDPs). To further elucidate the mechanisms that drive and regulate cell division, this project will characterize the function of five NCDPs using a range of cell biological, molecular, and genetic, and biochemical approaches to determine their localization, function and mode of regulation in cell division.

A fundamental question of basic neuroscience is: how do learners measure success in learning, or how does the brain evaluate behavioral outcomes in relation to a goal?  For example, parents serve as vocal tutors by uttering mature sounds (the goals) which human infants must learn to reproduce as they practice babbling.  Skill learning is thought to involve goal-directed evaluation of self-generated behavioral outcomes. The child evaluates how closely their babbling matches their parents? mature sounds. This gradually shapes brain circuits to select appropriate actions.  In this case, as infants compare their own babbling sounds to the mature goal sounds made by parents, they gradually learn to emulate those mature speech sounds. Vocal learning in songbirds provides a powerful model for studying how specific neural circuits mediate such experience-dependent skill learning during development.  Like human infants, young songbirds engage in a goal-oriented process in which evaluation of vocal utterances against a memory of goal sounds learned from a tutor guides gradual acquisition of learned vocal behavior.  As in other forms of skill learning, successful acquisition requires neural circuits to carry out comparisons of self-generated behavioral feedback to goal representations.  These studies will create new knowledge of how neural circuits mediate skill learning.  This new knowledge will be used to help in developing lesson plans for elementary-school students in areas with high proportions of under-represented minorities and training programs for teachers in order to advance science education and literacy.  <br/><br/>The objective of this research project is to investigate whether specific subcircuits within cortico-basal ganglia pathways mediate distinct aspects of goal-directed skill learning.  Using vocal learning in songbirds as an experimental model, the investigators will test the role of specific neural circuits in evaluating self-generated actions against a goal behavior as animals refine their motor output.  Juvenile songbirds learn a behavioral goal (memorized vocal sounds from a tutor) and produce variable behavioral output (babbling) during a process of trial-and-error learning in which actions that  match the learned goal sounds are gradually strengthened.  The research team will record neural activity in juvenile songbirds during development as they are actively engaged in learning; our strategy is to record from distinct subgroups of neurons identified by their selective tuning to either a neural representation of the goal or to feedback of self-generated behavior as juvenile birds begin to refine their behavioral output.  They posit that these two neural signals of goal-directed learning give rise to distinct subcircuits as part of the mechanism underlying action-outcome evaluations.  One major prediction is that cortical neurons that are selectively tuned to the memorized goal representation provide a filter for identifying behavior that matches the goal, and convey this information to the basal ganglia.  These data will provide an important test of how goal-similar actions are identified and processed in cortical circuits and their downstream targets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Congress facilitates international collaboration among researchers working in diverse fields (e.g., developmental biology, paleontology, functional morphology) and provides the opportunity for researchers to interact and to integrate vertebrate morphological research with other fields of biological sciences. Because many of the researchers attending the Congress also teach comparative vertebrate anatomy to undergraduates, the symposium will provide the opportunity to share teaching practices, integrating the field of vertebrate morphology with pedagogical research on how students learn. A major goal of the symposium is to define the core concepts of comparative vertebrate anatomy, a technique used by educators to focus students on learning big ideas and broad concepts instead of memorizing facts. Speakers will share evidence-based strategies for incorporating technological skills (e.g., 3D modeling) and inquiry-based teaching (e.g., social media outreach and service learning). The central goals of the symposium are to make comparative vertebrate anatomy more accessible to diverse student populations and to increase the diversity of future vertebrate anatomists. Both the articulation of core concepts of a field and inquiry-based teaching practices have been shown to foster retention and build problem solving and critical thinking skills. A keynote talk and workshop on inclusive teaching practices in biology are highlights of the symposium, and will be valuable to all scholar-educators in attendance. <br/>     <br/>The fields of vertebrate morphology and the scholarship of teaching and learning have grown rapidly since the last ICVM teaching workshop was held fifteen years ago. Both comparative vertebrate anatomy and human anatomy are common courses in the teaching repertoire of vertebrate morphologists who identify as teacher-scholars. A lack of well-defined core concepts, which exist for other fields of biology, has kept teacher-scholars of vertebrate morphology from fully implementing evidence-based strategies for teaching and learning. As a result, a misperception exists among students that comparative vertebrate morphology is an antiquated science that relies solely on memorization and has not embraced modern techniques and technology. Furthermore, outdated teaching practices reinforce the barriers to the success of underrepresented students. This symposium will push the boundaries of applying interdisciplinary approaches to the study of vertebrate comparative anatomy in the classroom. The diverse set of symposium speakers will share evidence-based strategies for incorporating technological skills (e.g., 3D visualization and modeling) and inquiry-based teaching (e.g., social media outreach and service learning). The symposium aims to forward the mission of NSF to create an engaged and inclusive community of teachers, students, and scholars. The core concepts, pedagogical approaches, and teaching resources identified at the symposium will be disseminated in publications resulting from the conference or on publicly available websites. <br/>     <br/>The award is co-funded by the BIO-IOS-Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program and the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even single cells have been shown to display primitive types of learning, but how such learning takes place, without a nervous system, is currently not understood.  In this project, a giant single cell organism, Stentor, will be used to explore how a single cell can learn.    Stentor cells are preyed upon in their natural habitat but can escape from attack by contracting into a ball when touched, but this contraction burns up energy.  For a Stentor cell sitting on a pond plant, it will often get tapped by pond plants or small algae that are not threatening.  In deciding whether or not to contract when touched, the Stentor cell relies on past experience.  The cells learn to ignore light, non-threatening touches, and only contract when hit with a larger aggressive force.   In an analogous way, humans living by a railroad track get used to the train and they don?t jump when they hear it go by.   This kind of learning is seen in all animals, but it is usually displayed in those with a nervous system.  Can single cells learn?  If so, how?  Single Stentor cells grown in the lab will be videotaped as they contract in response to a mechanical force, and the response will be measured when different genes are shut down.  This will reveal how the cell learns at a molecular level.  At the same time, a simple mathematical model of behavior will be used to: a) predict genes that are involved in sensing when touched; b) identify genes that are involved in driving the contraction; and c) identify how the cell decides whether or not to contract.  This project will show, for the first time, how a single cell is able to learn.  Broader Impact activities will include the interdisciplinary training of students along with public outreach activities. <br/><br/>Cells integrate multiple inputs and select between different behavioral responses, in some cases seeming to learn from experience.  The computational processes by which cells process information to generate appropriate behaviors remain poorly understood.  Learning is usually considered to be a feature of multicellular animals with some form of neuronal network, but the seeming ability of single cells to learn suggests it is a more general feature of life.  One of the most tractable systems for studying learning by a single cell is Stentor coeruleus, a giant cell that shows quantifiable behaviors in response to mechanical stimulation.  Repeated stimulation leads to habituation, in which the cell learns to ignore a stimulus of a particular magnitude.  Habituation in Stentor has been well documented, but the mechanistic basis is unknown.  In this project, an expert on the biology of Stentor coeruleus will team up with an expert on computational biology, to develop a quantitative understanding of how learning takes place in a single cell.  The project will combine quantitative measurements of cell responses with a simple two-state mathematical model for cellular learning and molecular perturbations of gene function, to ask fundamental questions about how learning takes place, identify key molecular pathways that underlie learning and memory in a cell, and probe the computational complexity of cellular decision-making.  Investigation of gene function will exploit proteomic and phosphoproteomic information to identify the sensory and effector molecules along with the signaling connections that link the stimulus to the response.   Once these elements are known, it will then be possible to determine which aspects of the system (sensory, effector, or signaling) are modulated during the learning process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Citizens, with and without higher educational backgrounds, are increasingly required to make impactful choices based on their understanding of biology. multimedia learning resources (illustrations, animations, interactive media) play an essential role in biology education and are a common feature not only in today's undergraduate science classrooms, but also in various informal learning settings (online/print news media and science museums for example). Instructors rely upon these visual learning resources for teaching and students seek them out in support of their studies. Despite the popularity of these resources, little is known about their efficacy in supporting learning in undergraduate biology. Indeed, the scientific accuracy, clarity, and quality of these resources can be highly variable. <br/><br/>A primary goal of the VISABLI network is to address an acknowledged gap between the communities responsible for the design and evaluation of scientific visualizations and the teachers who use these materials in the classroom. We seek to connect these distinct disciplines into a network fostering the co-creation of new knowledge and sparking innovative research; these three largely independent communities share a common goal of improving the design efficacy of instructional visualizations. The network activities will focus on an in-depth needs assessment, followed by meetings bringing together members of these three communities to identify and develop shared resources, and will conclude with a VISABLI website to disseminate them. We will work with the biology scientific societies to organize a series of workshops during which activities like collaborative storyboarding will give instructors a better sense of the visualization process and an appreciation for the difficult intersection of visualization design and pedagogy.

How the brain detects the violation of expectations and processes it to support learning and memory is unclear but is thought to involve several brain regions, prominent among which is the cerebellum. The cerebellum is known to regulate learning of fine movements and motor coordination, and its role in non-motor functions is only now beginning to be appreciated. The investigators in this project will determine the contribution of the cerebellum to emotional learning and memory. Specifically, the investigators are examining whether communication between the cerebellum and emotion-regulating brain circuits is necessary during learning and/or recollection of threat-related emotional memories. By using novel technologies, the investigators selectively and reversibly interfere with this communication in a spatially and temporally precise manner and can thus determine its functional significance. The knowledge gained from this investigation will inform understanding of cerebellar function and of the neurobiology of emotion, with implications for neurodevelopmental and post-traumatic stress disorders. The investigators also capitalize on the fact that formation of emotional memories is a fascinating topic to which people with diverse backgrounds can readily relate and are i) mentoring undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM in laboratory research; ii) continuing and expanding a public outreach initiative, which brings the latest brain science achievements to the general public and engages UC Davis trainees in public speaking to non-specialists; iii) disseminating information about brain science and research career choices to Hispanic communities locally and world-wide; and iv) are developing workshops for K-12 educators, to help further their science background and recommend ways to incorporate brain science in educational curricula.<br/><br/>There is growing appreciation for the modulatory role of the cerebellum in social and affective behaviors, in addition to its established role in motor control. However, the mechanistic link between the cerebellum and emotional learning and memory is lacking. Functional connections exist between the cerebellum and the amygdala, raising the exciting possibility that a cerebello-amygdala circuit processes information important for emotional learning and memory. The overarching objective of this proposal is to understand the role of the functional connectivity between the cerebellum and amygdala-based emotional circuits in learned emotion.  The investigators hypothesize that the cerebellum causally contributes to threat-related emotional learning and memory through projections to emotional circuits. They are testing this hypothesis at the microcircuit and synaptic levels through a multifaceted approach, which leverages the spatiotemporal resolution of optogenetic and pharmacogenetic tools to dissociate motor from non-motor effects. The expectation is that if communication between the cerebellum and specific emotional centers is necessary for learned emotion, then inhibition of cerebellar projections should impair aspects of learned emotion. The project is conceptually innovative because it assigns for the first time emotional functionality to cerebellar projections that are well-conserved across mammals but have received little attention to-date. It is also technically innovative because it employs for the first time an approach to the study of the cerebellum and learned emotion that minimizes compensatory effects and enables the separation of motor from non-motor contributions. The potential exists to break new ground in the understanding of cerebellar function and of the neurobiology of emotion. Finally, the project is of broad interest as it offers deep insights into principles of motivated behavior and sheds light into the role of traditionally-considered motor areas in non-motor functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Abstract concepts are brought to life in the field because the natural world stimulates students? curiosity, encourages active participation, and builds team camaraderie. For these reasons and more, the recommendations for implementing change in undergraduate biology education (e.g., ?integrating core concepts?, ?focus on student-centered learning?; AAAS 2011) are exemplified by field coursework and research. Despite their proven benefits, opportunities for fieldwork in undergraduate biology education are waning. This is alarming in light of rapidly increasing human impacts on ecosystems, and the growing disconnect between people and nature. To address this ?nature deficit?, the Diversify and Integrate Marine Education at Stations (DIMES) network will engage scientists and learners at marine stations along the west coast of the North America to create a unified curriculum that documents change in biodiversity while combining fieldwork and computational literacy in undergraduate education. By connecting participants from a variety of academic institutions, the DIMES network will diversify the undergraduate audience served by marine stations. By integrating a field curriculum across western North America, educators will engage students with pressing scientific questions in an age of rapid biological change. This network will leverage the existing undergraduate teaching at participating marine laboratories and expand their reach to new students who lack access to experiential learning.<br/><br/>Field courses share a common philosophy centered on local natural history and experiential learning, but this knowledge is rarely placed within a broader context in an explicit, quantitative manner ? a shortcoming in an era of global human impacts. The proposed unified field curriculum will integrate the traditional place-based approach within a biogeographic framework by developing innovative modules that combine data across the network to address questions at larger spatial and temporal scales. By linking explicitly environmental change, biogeography, and natural history, the DIMES network will maintain the relevance of curricula offered at these stations and export the modules to other institutions. Moreover, the network will develop a partnership of educators from diverse institutions that span R1 to community college, and that vary in their shore access, to expand the reach of marine stations beyond their walls. This network of instructors will develop curricula and assessment tools that can be implemented in classrooms with varying levels of field time, with the goal of identifying mechanisms to minimize the hypothesized learning gap between students with and without shore access.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop is intended to increase the participation in the grant review process by scientists from underrepresented groups and increase the probability that they themselves will successfully obtain grants for their research. The workshop provides a two-day hands-on event to be held in the Washington D.C. area in spring or summer 2020. As an outcome of the workshop, participants will obtain the knowledge and competencies in reviewing grant proposals and will increase their participation in the grant review process. Over the course of the workshop, participants will learn to critique grant proposal drafts as well as develop their own drafts with the guidance of peers and mentors from funding agencies. Participants will be selected based on their interest in learning the peer review process and the potential impact of the workshop on their career. Faculty and early career scientists at HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, and other minority-serving institutions are especially encouraged to apply.<br/><br/>This workshop uses a novel approach of bringing together representatives of funding agencies to provide a broad set of perspectives for early career scientists interested in both grant writing and the grant review process. The project will train early career scientists who will be provided with strategies for effective networking. As a result, it is expected that participants will support each other, form a cohesive cohort group, and practice what they learned at the workshop. Successfully securing grant funding is critical to the professional development of early career scientists, and yet professionals from historically underrepresented and marginalized communities receive grant funding at rates lower than their majority colleagues. At the workshop, participants will learn how to effectively communicate their research ideas in a written format (proposal), become aware of how proposals are reviewed, learn the criteria used in a review, and become increasingly confident of their ability to write a competitive proposal and provide useful critical review of other proposals.

The ultimate goal of this project is to determine how animals navigate in dynamic environments to advance our understanding of the perceptual, learning, and memory mechanisms underlying navigation. The outcomes of this research provide an understanding of dynamic control systems, reveal how the nervous system has evolved to handle unpredictability, and drive the development of novel navigational algorithms and biological sensors.  This project is designed to provide learning and research opportunities to expand interdisciplinary education for underrepresented groups in the STEM majors. The investigator integrates this research into curriculum at multiple levels: (i) an introductory module that engages first-year biology students to use models and simulations to understand how animals move through the world; (ii) the development of a summer research program that recruits undergraduate students; (iii) the establishment of collaboration with high-school biology teachers to help establish the interdisciplinary approach to biology education before students enter university.<br/><br/>Insect navigation studies have a long history, but the mechanisms of control in changing naturalistic environments remain relatively unexamined. An integrative approach is used to elucidate how perception of the environment is computed and stored in the nervous system and acted upon by an organism. There are three major aims in the proposed research:  (i) identify the local and global visual features that ants extract from naturalistic panoramic scenes; (ii) determine how the viewing behavior of ants comes to be directed towards the local and global cues used for route guidance; (iii) define the role of memory in stabilizing routes in the face of change. The proposed research brings the unpredictable nature of the field into the lab by employing virtual naturalistic environments in which complexity and instability can be introduced in a systematic fashion.  For example, the investigator can add, remove, or displace the visual features within a scene in a closed-loop fashion simulating natural occurring changes in lighting conditions, wind displacement, and terrain geometry. This research is of general interest to visual and behavioral neuroscientists and to computer scientists working with autonomous robots.  Visually dependent tasks that are broadly similar across a wide variety of animals with well-developed visual systems tend to have areas of convergence in their generating algorithms (e.g. path integration, visually guided navigation), although the specific neural implementation may differ between species. Insect navigational behavior provides an ideal platform to develop precise control models to describe and simulate cellular events, neural circuits, and complex behavior."

Similarly, it is important to understand how ATP is used to fuel biological machines and control key cellular processes.  A detailed understanding is also needed for the origin of the directional motions of biological motors that generate forces in muscular, cardiac and neural cells.

Building on a grassroots effort of 50 Field Stations and Marine Laboratories representing 34 field site networks (e.g., NEON, LTER, LTAR, GLEON), this project will leverage existing collaborations, programs and initiatives to: establish a field learning portal to advertise and distribute virtual materials and live-streaming research-based field events to universities across the U.S.; create novel cross-site virtual field learning experiences that boost critical observation and research skills; evaluate the efficacy of virtual field experiences on student learning outcomes. These experiences will help fulfill graduation requirements and prepare undergraduates and graduates impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic for future careers.<br/><br/>This pandemic offers unique opportunities to generate insights for the development of virtual field experiences as a novel teaching tool. The urgent need for virtual teaching materials across all disciplines encourages adoption by faculty who might otherwise never have used either virtual or field experiences in their courses.  The synchronous prioritization of virtual offerings by field stations and marine laboratories opens the window to creating a broad array of multi-site virtual experiences around the world. The resulting dramatic expansion in the availability and use of virtual field experiences can create new opportunities to assess the effects of this teaching tool on student observation and research skills and to enhance preparedness for future disruptions.

However, mechanisms that protect the genome generally limit genome modifications to small changes in DNA sequence. Given this paradox, how do organisms adapt to new conditions?  One way to study this question is with prions.  Prion proteins adopt multiple conformations (or shapes), and these unusual and diverse conformations drive a paradigm-shifting mode of inheritance that is based on changes in protein shape rather than changes in DNA sequence. Although best known as the cause of mad cow disease, the majority of the nearly two-dozen prions that have now been identified are benign or beneficial. One such prion, termed [GAR+], controls a fundamental decision in metabolism: whether to harvest energy by breaking down glucose in the absence of oxygen (fermentation) or to harvest energy through the breakdown of glucose (or other organic substrates)in the presence of oxygen (respiration).  This metabolic switch between fermentation and respiration has been associated with a diverse array of disease states.  It was recently discovered that many bacteria secrete small molecules that induce the [GAR+] prion in neighboring eukaryotic cells. Mathematical modeling suggests that both organisms derive benefit from this interaction in some circumstances. However, this interaction can disrupt industrially important fermentation processes and may be harmful to human health. The recent recognition that the microorganisms associated with an organism are often correlated with certain disease states suggests that lessons we learn from better understanding the interactions between prion proteins and bacteria will have broad significance.  Therefore, this project will characterize the interactions between bacteria and yeast that result in prion acquisition, and work to identify the compound(s) produced by bacteria that induces the prion.  The experimental methods and data analysis approaches developed will be useful for studying a variety of systems, and the results will be transmitted to the public through peer-reviewed publications and training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.  Undergraduate and high school students and teachers will be introduced to the scientific process and will be taught how to design experiments in quantitative cell and molecular biology.  High school students will be recruited for a ""boot camp"" style course that will include developing teaching modules, training of K-12 science teachers, and working with Stanford University's Center for Teaching and Learning.  Undergraduate students will be recruited for the project from existing programs that focus on students from underrepresented backgrounds (including Stanford Amgen-SSRP Scholars Program).  A two-week ""Methods and Logic in Chemical and Systems Biology Boot Camp"" for incoming graduate students will be developed which will teach inquiry-based learning and directly integrate concepts and experiments from the project.<br/><br/><br/>Adaptation to changing environments requires the rapid acquisition of new heritable traits, generally ascribed to mutations. However, epigenetic mechanisms can also generate phenotypic diversity among genetically identical cells. Among these mechanisms, self-perpetuating protein conformations, known as prions, are emerging as an important means of generating phenotypic diversity that is heritable from one generation to the next. Recent studies suggest that these elements are common in wild fungi, where they often confer adaptive traits.  An ancient biological circuit in fungi and many other eukaryotes normally prevents the use of other carbon sources when glucose is present. The [GAR+] prion reverses yeast's strong glucose repression. Although organisms have largely been studied in isolation, in the wild they compete and cooperate in complex communities, and it was recently discovered that bacteria can secrete a chemical factor that elicits the [GAR+] appearance. This induction can provide strong benefits to yeast and bacteria alike. Bacteria benefit because [GAR+] yeast produce less ethanol, creating a less toxic environment. [GAR+] yeast benefit from enhanced growth on mixed carbon sources and greater longevity. Four specific aims will investigate this novel interspecies interaction and the ensuing heritable shift in metabolism: 1) Identify and characterize genes that control interspecies communication, 2) Identify the bacterial signal that induces the [GAR+] prion, 3) Investigate how [GAR+] influences cooperation and cheating in mixed populations, and 4) Characterize mechanisms that drive the [GAR+] metabolic switch using systems-level approaches.  Although dozens of prions have been discovered in the past decade, we lack understanding of their physiological consequences and of factors that regulate their acquisition and loss. This research will employ novel methods to dramatically enhance our understanding of what is emerging as a conserved and fundamental biological process. The experimental methodology and data analysis platforms developed will be useful for studying a variety of systems, and will lead to new insights into how a prion can heritably transform one of the most fundamental decisions in metabolism, and in particular how such regulatory decisions can be fueled by cross-kingdom chemical communication."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The Fellow will characterize the navigation and diving abilities of northern elephant seal pups. Three months after birth these young animals begin their first migration, learning to navigate and forage without any parental instruction. Despite exhibiting the farthest independent migration of any mammal, it is unknown how these seals find their way, or their way home, in a seemingly featureless ocean. In the next 100 years, increases in sea surface temperature and decreases in primary productivity are expected in the North Pacific Ocean. These changes are expected to affect northern elephant seals by shifting their critical foraging habitat northward by 1,000km and deeper in the water column. Thus, it is important to determine whether elephant seal navigation and diving are genetically passed on from mother to daughter and if so, how that might limit their adaptive capacities to predicted climate change. <br/><br/>The Fellow will work with sponsoring scientist Dr. Daniel Costa from the University of California Santa Cruz to analyze existing and newly-collected tracking and diving data from mother elephant seals and their female pups. Using a novel simulation model, the Fellow will predict the impacts of climate change on a predator with top-down ecosystem control. In these ways, the Fellow will be trained in cutting-edge biologging and computational techniques and will obtain professional development opportunities in science communication. Animal navigation is an intriguing field that provides an ideal basis for teaching students key concepts in behavior, ecology, and evolution. By incorporating results into high school biology learning modules, the Fellow will gain valuable teaching skills. Research findings will also be communicated with docents and visitors at the A?o Nuevo State Park research site in collaboration with the State Park PORTS distance learning program. Finally, the Fellow will provide hands-on research experience to undergraduate and graduate students, with an emphasis on broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells need to make the right proteins, at the right time, in the right quantities, and so this process is carefully controlled by signals that are also encoded in the RNA. These signals are complex and only just beginning to be understood because there are thousands of different RNA sequences in a cell and each is hundreds to thousands of nucleotides (""letters"") long. Recent advances in DNA & RNA sequencing technology mean that we can now measure all parts of RNA that are translated into protein and how much by using a technique called ribosome profiling. Although this technique is amazing, it is not perfect, and statistical tools are needed to separate the interesting biological signals in the data from unwanted biases of the experimental measurement. These tools need to be implemented in usable and reliable software in order for all scientists studying studying protein synthesis to be able to get the maximum possible information from ribosome profiling data, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect. The RiboViz software suite, which is open source and free to use by anyone in the world, already takes raw data from sequencing machines and puts it through a series of processing steps. RiboViz estimates how much each part of RNA is translated, and how the amount of translation is controlled by the code of that RNA. RiboViz produces tables, figures and graphs that are accessible online, so is useful for both experts and non-experts. This kind of data sharing makes science more reproducible and more accessible. <br/><br/>This project will accelerate understanding of the mechanism and regulation of protein synthesis by extending the RiboViz open-source computational pipeline to extract biological insight from high-throughput data measuring protein synthesis. The goal is to further develop the RiboViz open-source software pipeline (https://github.com/shahpr/RiboViz) for accessible, reliable, reproducible, rigorous and bias-aware analysis and visualization of ribosome profiling data. Specific aims are to refactor RiboViz following best practices for scientific computing, by writing tests akin to experimental controls for each step of the setup, processing and analysis, and by containerization of the pipeline to enable running on different computers with full control of software dependencies; develop likelihood-based statistical methods for quantification of differential translation of open reading frames and codons while correcting for sequence-level bias, building on best practices in differential RNA abundance analysis, and implement these analysis and visualization tools within RiboViz; and to generate standardized ribosome profiling datasets by re-analyzing published datasets for all eukaryotes to quantify rigorously how codon usage and other sequence features predict protein synthesis. The improved RiboViz pipeline will accelerate studies of translation regulation and produce tested and rigorous tools that we will be disseminated as an open-source resource to the entire community studying translation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After the virus infects a cell, the viral replicase enzyme makes thousands of copies of the viral genome.  This project will determine the molecular features of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome that enable it to be copied by the coronavirus replicase complex.  Having determined those features, the PIs will use that knowledge to design genome-like molecules that may interfere with replication of normal genomes and thus have potential as novel therapeutic agents.  The PIs will evaluate the effectiveness of the genome-like molecules at blocking virus replication in cells and in more complicated tissue culture that includes a variety of different cell types meant to mimic the conditions in the human lung.  Additionally, the project will broaden participation in STEM by funding a Latina post-doctoral scholar to perform most of the experiments.<br/><br/>The PIs will use a combination of biochemistry and culture to determine the minimal features of a SARS-CoV-2 replicon that enable it to be replicated.  Next, the PIs will apply that knowledge to design defective-interfering RNA that can be replicated very efficiently yet does not encode infectious virus particles.  Extending from natural defective-interfering particles in other viruses, this RNA will likely serve as a template for the coronavirus replicase. When an intact virus penetrates a cell that contains defective-interfering RNA, the defective interfering RNA will serve as a template for the virus replicase.  Doing so will interfere with viral replication by occupying the replicase and consuming nucleotides that could otherwise be incorporated into new intact virus genomes.   The interfering RNAs will be delivered using a virus-like particle system designed to enter cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and the protease necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry.   The PIs will determine the extent to which defective-interfering particles block replication in simple tissue culture or in human airway epithelial organoids, which have multiple differentiated cell types iorganized similarly to those found in explanted tissue.  The epithelial organoids are derived from healthy human tissue donors and represent some of the genetic diversity in human populations.

These organisms are increasingly exposed to a number of environmental stresses as a result of pollution and ocean acidification.  Thiols, small molecules, containing a characteristic sulfhydryl group, are key protectants against environmental stresses. In particular, thiols react with the amino acid cysteine in proteins, in a process called thiolation, and protect these amino acids from irreversible inactivation by oxidative stress. It has long been known that cyanobacteria contain a thiol called glutathione; however, recently another thiol, ergothioneine, has been identified in cyanobacteria.  This project explores the role of glutathione and ergothioneine in cyanobacteria.  First, in an undergraduate microbiology course, a survey of thiols in species of cyanobacteria, isolated from terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments will be undertaken to provide a comprehensive view of thiols in cyanobacteria.  Second, the function of glutathione and ergothioneine will be studied in the model cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803 and Synechococcus PCC7942, with the use of mutants lacking glutathione, ergothioneine, or both thiols. These mutants will be exposed to various environmental stresses to see how well they deal with them.  Identification of proteins that require glutathione and ergothioneine as cofactors will be attempted and proteomics will be performed to determine which cyanobacterial proteins are protected by thiolation during environmental stress.  The ultimate aim of this research project is to evaluate the relative contribution of different thiols in cyanobacteria in protecting the cells against environmental stresses.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This research will be performed by undergraduate and Master's level graduate research assistants, working on research projects and in project oriented learning classes in molecular biology and microbiology.

They propose to re-apply similar adaptive optics techniques in multiphoton microscopy to obtain diffraction-limited images from deep within living biological tissues. This development will provide biologists with new imaging capabilities, similar to advantages adaptive optics provided to astronomers, enabling them to obtain the highestresolution deep-tissue images in neurobiology to study brain development and synapse plasticity in the nervous system, in cell biology to study cell cycle events, and in developmental biology to study stem cells, chromatin remodeling and the cytoskeleton.

By increasing the imaging depth beyond 1,000 um they can reach the Hippocampus, the site for learning and memory. This will allow studies of how synapses reorganize during learning and how they encode for long-lasting memory."

These complex traits include multiple components, so they are unlikely to be shaped by a single gene.  Recent evidence from insects, birds, plants, and fungi suggests that many different complex traits may be controlled by common genetic structures called supergenes, which lock together two or more genes with coordinated actions so that beneficial combinations are transmitted together to offspring.  In this study, the researchers will investigate characteristics of a supergene that controls social organization in a group of ants.  The project will specifically ask about how an ancient supergene changes in form and function in a group of related species.  In addition to expanding the current knowledge of how complex traits emerge and persist, this study will also provide new insights into the causes and consequences of alternative social strategies in ants.  Students will participate in every aspect of this study, and the research team will participate in outreach events to raise community awareness about entomology.  Undergraduate students will gain hands-on experience in contemporary genomics techniques, both in the classroom and as research assistants.  Graduate students will compile existing knowledge about the causes and consequences of alternative social strategies across all social organisms, which will broaden the scope of the discoveries from this project.<br/><br/>Social organization involving cooperation among non-relatives has originated repeatedly in social insects, yet the proximate and ultimate drivers of this transition remain enigmatic.  The proposed research will build upon the recent discovery of an ancestral supergene composed of about 500 linked genes that underlies social structure in multiple socially polymorphic Formica ant species. Emerging evidence suggests that supergenes commonly control complex traits, from mimetic coloration in butterflies to mating strategies in birds, but scientists are only beginning to understand the characteristics and dynamics of these genomic structures.  This project will address in parallel two major questions: how do autosomal supergenes evolve and persist, and how and why do societies composed of non-relatives repeatedly evolve.  Aim 1 will investigate whether alternative supergene variants undergo changes in gene content, gene order, and protein coding sequence as they persist in speciating lineages.  Undergraduate researchers will be trained in genomics and bioinformatics techniques and will lead intraspecific analyses of their own Formica species.  In complement, aim 2 will examine how supergene genotype influences individual- and colony-level traits.  Students in introductory biology classes will participate in data collection for this aim.  Finally, aim 3 will determine whether the distribution of social organization and genetic control varies along biogeographic axes.  A graduate student seminar will broaden discoveries from this aim by conducting a meta-analysis of ecological drivers of social polymorphism across social insects. This project will provide excellent learning opportunities for students at all levels and is poised to expand the understanding of social evolution and the genetics of complex traits.<br/><br/>This work is being funded jointly by the Behavioral Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Evolutionary Processes Cluster in the Division of Environmental Biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A particularly common mechanism that instructs cells what type to become involves communication via proteins on their surface. The Zeller laboratory studies this process in a simple animal model called an ascidian that allows them to observe individual cells and manipulate the functions of their proteins. This project will utilize an approach called optogenetics, in which a specific color of light manipulates the function of these cell surface proteins to alter how cells communicate with one another. By illuminating the ascidian embryo at different times, they can manipulate the process of cell communication precisely to learn how this mechanism operates. This will be one of the first applications of optogenetics in ascidians and they will provide the broader scientific community with the set of tools that they develop. In addition, they will develop learning modules for both undergraduate and graduate-level courses to provide students with an opportunity to use optogenetics. Lastly, they will share this work with the public by developing an activity that demonstrates the principles of optogenetics to children that will be incorporated into our lab?s annual open house presentation at the San Diego State University Marine Laboratory.<br/><br/>The ascidian larval peripheral nervous system (PNS) is composed of a series of ciliated sensory neurons that are patterned, in part, by Notch-mediated lateral inhibition. The sensory neurons express two Notch ligands, Delta and Jagged, at different times and in different spatial domains suggesting that more complex Notch signaling, including lateral induction, may play a role in spatial patterning. To investigate this, the Zeller laboratory will utilize an ontogenetically-regulated transcription factor, coupled with tissue-specifically expressed CRISPR reagents to manipulate Notch ligand function with precise spatiotemporal control. By manipulating the function of both Notch ligands individually and simultaneously at different times during PNS development they will tease apart patterning contributions from lateral inhibition and induction. This will be one of the first uses of optogenetics in ascidians and they will provide reagents to the broader scientific community. Using optogenetics-based approaches in other experimental systems will provide a level of precise spatiotemporal regulation that is currently difficult to achieve. They will develop an optogenetics module that will be introduced into one or more advanced undergraduate laboratory courses at San Diego State University and introduce graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to optogenetics by developing a laboratory module in the ascidian section of the Embryology Course at the Marine Biology Laboratory in Woods Hole.

This pronounced gap between animal performance and technology stems, in part, from fundamental gaps in the understanding of muscle physiology and mechanical function. Muscle is the only actively controlled tissue in animal musculoskeletal systems, and therefore plays a central role in enabling and controlling movement. Yet, developments over the past 20 years have led to growing recognition that important problems in muscle physiology and movement sciences remain unsolved and the theoretical foundation of the field remains incomplete. In particular, the ability to model and predict muscle function under dynamic and perturbed locomotor conditions remains poor. This project will combine innovative experimental techniques with modeling approaches to develop new muscle models that can explain and predict muscle movement under a broad range of conditions.  The findings have potential to transform numerous fields? enabling neuroscientists, biologists, clinicians and biomedical engineers to ask questions about human and animal behavior, control of motion, function of muscles and bones, and capacity of the nervous system and muscles to change. The research team will collaborate with colleagues in clinical and engineering fields to translate the findings into applications in human rehabilitation, treatment of disease and injury, and the design and control of assistive technology such as prosthetics and exoskeleton devices.<br/><br/>In the field of animal neuromechanics, a pronounced gap exists between ?top down? approaches ? those that focus on whole-animal behavior but lack insight into underlying mechanisms? vs ?bottom-up? approaches ? those that characterize mechanisms but lack insight into their contributions to animal behavior. The team will develop new tools to bridge this gap: 1) predictive muscle models that include intrinsic viscoelastic properties; and 2) experimental approaches that integrate across levels. This project?s novel ?muscle avatar? approach will help bridge this gap, and enable rigorous analysis of intrinsic muscle property and neural activation contributions to control of locomotion. Aim 1 tests the ability of the muscle avatar approach to replicate steady and perturbed in vivo work loop patterns in mouse and guinea fowl muscles. In Aim 2, in vivo muscle strain, activation, and force will be measured during steady and perturbed running in guinea fowl muscles, and the muscle avatar will be used to quantitatively assess how intrinsic muscle properties and neural drive each contribute to stabilizing responses. In Aim 3, alternative muscle models will be developed, and the ability of each model to predict in vivo muscle function in high strain and perturbed contraction conditions will be compared. Computationally tractable muscle models are essential for closed loop neuromechanical simulations of locomotion, which are increasingly used to understand how muscle function and sensorimotor control change in response to aging, injury and neuromuscular disorders. The findings could inform clinical rehabilitation strategies and the design of assistive devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These leading-edge I/H methods integrate information from different sources to determine the structures of complex biomolecular assemblies, analogous to assembling the pieces of a puzzle to build a three-dimensional object. Some of the landmark structures determined using I/H methods include the nuclear pore complex that enables the transport of proteins across the nuclear membrane and the proteasomal lid sub-complex that regulates the degradation of damaged, malfunctioning or toxic proteins in the cell. There is currently no repository capable of archiving these I/H structures so that they are available for downstream scientific and biomedical applications. The current project builds a comprehensive software pipeline to support the validation, curation and dissemination of I/H models so that they are freely available to the broader community. The outcomes of this project will make key structures of biological assemblies accessible to researchers, educators and students around the world. This project will impact scientists who use structural biology data for their research as well as students and educators who study the role of structure in biology. This research will directly and significantly enhance the field of biology and medicine and extend its impact on the broader community through education and outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project extends a previously developed prototype system (PDB-Dev) by building the complete data pipeline for the curation, validation and delivery of I/H models. This will be achieved through the creation of an automated deposition system to support a broad range of I/H models; development of annotation and validation pipelines for processing I/H models by leveraging existing protocols and tools; development of new tools for visualizing multi-scale model representations and model uncertainly; creation of a service architecture to manage data exchange among federated resources capable of supporting evolutionary improvements of I/H models and associated experimental data; and development of a delivery platform to support data set discovery and to provide web services for searching, reporting, and data download. Since I/H methods integrate information from several experimental and computational techniques, this project also prototypes a new centralized software environment that facilitates automated communication and exchange of data among a federation of structural biology model and data repositories contributing to I/H modeling. These developments will lead to a robust system capable to archiving and disseminating I/H models to the public in a standard form.

Successfully navigating the environment requires the brain to be capable of learning and remembering specific features of the environment. In mammals, males tend to have better spatial memory, and for decades, scientists have explained this as a necessity for males to navigate over larger areas in search of mates. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested, and other researchers have recently suggested that male superiority in spatial abilities might be a side-effect of testosterone. Rainforest frogs will be used to test between these alternative hypotheses. In contrast to mammals, frogs have both the species where males roam larger rainforest areas and species where females have larger home ranges than males. Potential sex differences in navigational ability will be measured across a range of species in the field by tracking their ability to return home after displacements. Then, standardized behavioral assays will be used in the lab to detect any sex differences across various species and identify the brain regions used for spatial memory. Finally, the neuroanatomy of the amphibian hippocampus will be investigated to determine if frogs use similar or different brain mechanisms for navigation compared to mammals. Comparing these mechanisms will shed light on the evolution of spatial capabilities in animals, including humans. These research activities will be integrated into education by collaborating with Stanford undergraduates and Canada Community College students to perform behavior experiments.<br/><br/>The ability to navigate the environment is essential for survival and reproductive success. Sex differences in spatial abilities have been documented in many taxa. In mammals, males often outperform females and this superiority in spatial ability has been attributed to sex differences in life history strategies where polygamous males maintain larger home ranges. Recent challenges to this theory suggest that improved spatial ability is a byproduct of high testosterone in males rather than an adaptation to different life history strategies. The authors will directly test these alternative hypotheses using an amphibian clade with contrasting life histories and spatial strategies of males and females through three aims: 1) Examine sex differences in navigational ability by tracking translocated frogs in the wild in three species with sex differences in home range size. 2) Test for species variation and the role of androgens in spatial memory. Additional experiments will test the influence of androgens on task performance and link performance differences to patterns of neural activity. 3) Define the neuroanatomy of the amphibian medial pallium (homolog of the mammalian hippocampus) using single nuclei sequencing, sequencing active neurons, and tract tracing to examine potential sex and species differences in pallial connectivity. Together, this work will contrast and test life-history adaptation and testosterone spill-over hypotheses using ecologically-relevant behavioral assays in the wild, controlled behavioral assays in the laboratory, and neuroanatomical studies.

In mammals, the hippocampal memory system is a conglomerate of brain structures that function together to support memory formation. In doing so, this memory system associates, or binds together, people, items, and places into what are known as episodic memories. Episodic memories afford species the ability to remember vital information that increases the likelihood of survival, such as securing long-term food sources. In this example, the animal must remember ""what"" was stored, ""where"" it was stored, and ""when"" it was stored to retrieve the food before it spoils and avoid illness in the process. Within the hippocampal memory system, the predominant role of one structure, called the perirhinal cortex, is to supply a representation of ""what"" information (e.g., what food item was stored). The perirhinal cortex also appears to be involved in complex stimulus representations outside of its role in episodic memory; however, how and under which circumstances the perirhinal cortex is involved in stimulus representation is currently under debate. This project assesses how the perirhinal cortex functions in a perceptual-specific versus a memory-specific manner in its representation of item information. In addition, the project examines whether the role of the perirhinal cortex in stimulus representation involves connections with structures outside of the hippocampal memory system. Results will furnish significant insight into the contributions of the perirhinal cortex to stimulus representation and how it may differ or complement its well-established role in episodic memory within the hippocampal memory system.  All components of the research program provide training opportunities to students at California State University-Sacramento, a minority serving and primarily undergraduate institution. Additionally, outreach events provide students with opportunities to increase STEM-awareness in the community.<br/><br/>Currently, it is debated how the perirhinal cortex may function in stimulus representation, and if this function is independent from its mnemonic role within the hippocampal memory system. This project uses an associative learning paradigm (Pavlovian fear conditioning) in combination with an innovative inactivation method, Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, and cross-lesion techniques to evaluate the functional role of the perirhinal cortex in stimulus representation. Specifically, using the laboratory rat as a model system the project aims to: 1) examine the characteristics of stimuli that require the perirhinal cortex for stimulus representation; 2) determine whether the role of perirhinal cortex in stimulus representation is perceptual, mnemonic or a combination; and 3) determine whether in stimulus representation the perirhinal cortex relies on direct connections with structures outside of the hippocampal memory system.  The research project provides extensive training opportunities to students at California State University-Sacramento, which is a minority serving and primarily undergraduate institution. Further, community outreach, which includes events that expose elementary school girls to science, promote university-wide brain awareness and present research findings to the local community, provide students with opportunities to increase STEM-awareness in the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One aspect of biodiversity that directly impacts human health is its importance in mitigating risk of disease transmission from wildlife.  A prominent theory in ecology is that greater diversity of species reduces the risk of disease transmission, through an effect called dilution. Evidence for the dilution effect has been found in several disease systems, including Lyme disease.  Greater species diversity of small mammals that serve as hosts for Lyme disease result in less transmission of the disease.  However, even in this well-studied system, there is little research on the importance of genetic variation within the Lyme disease pathogen. This project focuses on the Lyme disease system, to address a critical question in disease ecology: how does species diversity of hosts influence pathogen genetic diversity and what does the culmination of these interactions mean for disease risk? This project also will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students, will develop active learning focused courses on disease ecology, and will engage the public in tick-borne disease biology through citizen science opportunities. This research has clear public health implications as Lyme disease is the most reported tick transmitted disease in the United States<br/><br/>This study will incorporate empirical field studies and mathematical modeling to characterize and predict the relationship between host diversity and pathogen genetic diversity in the Lyme disease system in the western United States.

This project will use cutting-edge genomic tools to study how genes expressed in the placenta influence the brains and behavior of mothers as well as their offspring. The project focuses on imprinted genes, a group of genes that are critical to placental function and brain development. The expression of imprinted genes depends on parent-of-origin: some are expressed exclusively from the maternal copy, and some from the paternal copy. Disruption of this unusual expression pattern in mouse placenta alters the behavior and physiology of mothers. In humans, imprinted genes are linked to mood and cognition disorders. The research team will use a novel mouse model and classic behavioral tests to assess how and when imprinted genes exert their effects on mothers and offspring. They will also recruit and mentor Native American student researchers, and provide hands-on research experiences for high school science teachers. The teachers will develop lesson plans based on their research, and will enhance their scientific literacy by learning more about evolution, genetics and behavior.<br/><br/>Placental complexity, maternal care, and a highly developed forebrain are defining features of eutherian mammals. Imprinted genes affect all three phenotypes but little is known about how these effects are integrated across tissues (placenta, brain), genotypes (mother, offspring), and development (perinatal, adult). The researchers will assess the role of imprinted genes in these interactions by measuring the effects of placental loss of imprinting (LOI) on mothers, of developmental LOI on embryonic brain and neonatal behavior, and the combined effects of LOI and maternal environment on adult brain and behavior. They do so in a tractable hybrid system, in which potentially opposing effects of LOI for paternally vs. maternally imprinted genes can be enumerated. Effects of placental LOI on mothers will be tested by profiling the behavior, neural transcriptomes (RNAseq) and hormone levels of pregnant females, and the behavior of nursing mothers. In parallel, they will measure expression (RNAseq) and DNA methylation (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing) in embryonic brain and placenta, and behavior in neonates. Cross-fostering will separate effects of altered maternal care in mothers exposed to placental LOI, from effects of developmental LOI, on behavior and neural gene expression and methylation in adult animals. These studies will test the hypothesis that imprinted genes regulate the intimate and obligate relationship between mammalian mothers and young, and will advance understanding of the combined effects of genotype, epigenotype and rearing environment on brain and behavior, and the role of imprinted genes in placental signaling and in shaping the adult brain."

The research will measure how well forests are recovering after nearly two decades of different treatments at many sites. The study will also answer questions about how important nearby forest patches are to the recovery of the restored sites. Results will provide critical guidance to land managers and policymakers on how and where to invest limited resources to improve forest restoration efforts.

Sites are surrounded by a range of low to high forest cover. Each site has three experimental treatments: (1) low intensity -- no tree planting and natural recovery, (2) medium intensity -- planting tree islands of three sizes, and (3) high intensity -- planting the entire plot with trees. New research activities will include conducting an intensive survey of all tree recruits in restoration and reference forest plots for the first time to thoroughly quantify rare, later-successional recruits. A detailed map of forest cover and individual focal tree species surrounding the sites will be created to assess the importance of proximity to seed sources. To better understand factors limiting forest recovery, investigators will measure seed dispersal and conduct seed-additional experiments. Overall, the project will use field data and remote sensing techniques to address a host of key debates in tropical community ecology about the dynamics of later-successional tree recruitment.

Migratory birds coordinate their departure from wintering grounds in Central or South America to arrive at North American breeding grounds at just the right time. Too early and they risk experiencing severe weather from late frosts or blizzards. Too late and they risk missing the peak in early spring insects that they depend on to successfully raise offspring. For their part, insects such as butterflies also benefit when their emergence coincides with the springtime flush of new plant growth. The timing of spring has been shifting earlier in recent years, and this raises the possibility of mismatches in spring timing between birds, insects, and plants. A few local scale studies have suggested that such mismatches may be responsible for long-term population declines for some species, but the extent of this problem, especially over large areas remains unknown. In this project, the research team will combine information on springtime weather, satellite imagery on plant emergence, and multiple large-scale citizen science data on birds, butterflies, and caterpillars to perform a comprehensive evaluation of mismatches in seasonal timing between interacting species. This work is critical for understanding the potential impacts of continued shifts in seasonality on living systems. The work will also engage K-college students and the public through a new citizen science program, educational units, and outreach events focused on learning about the timing of seasonal changes. <br/><br/>The proposed research will be the first attempt to examine phenological mismatch across three trophic levels at a semi-continental extent. Local-scale studies have documented specific instances of phenological mismatch but fail to inform how mismatch consequences propagate across spatial, temporal, or trophic scales. Birds and butterflies provide the most expansive, long-term and detailed macroecological data sets on distribution, diversity, and demography. The project will unite multiple large-scale citizen science datasets for these taxa with targeted field data collection, and remotely-sensed climate and vegetation data layers, to examine the cross-scale and multi-trophic interactions that connect shifting thermal environments, phenological mismatch, and fitness consequences. This will be accomplished by: (1) assembling and uniting continental and regional monitoring and citizen-science databases for Lepidoptera and birds; (2) building spatio-temporal models in order to assess drivers of phenology, calculate direct metrics of phenological mismatch across trophic levels, and evaluate fitness and population consequences of those mismatches; and (3) testing the ability of generated models to predict phenology and population trends for focal birds and Lepidoptera across eastern North America as a function of tri-trophic phenological mismatch. Taking a macro-scale perspective on phenological mismatch is critical for understanding the range-wide impacts of sustained trends in seasonal timing. In addition to answering critical research questions on phenological mismatch the team will extend the impacts of their work through both specific training opportunities and broad-based education and outreach efforts."

Key factors that affect whether a tree survives a drought include the anatomy of the cells (xylem) that conduct water and make up the wood, and how the tree invests resources toward wood growth versus reproduction versus defending itself from insects. These factors can all vary between individual trees. This project aims to improve scientific understanding of how investment of carbon resources affects survival in a severe drought by combining measurements of all these functions. The researchers will make use of forest plots in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, many of which exhibited high tree death in the historic 2012-2016 drought. A small cylinder of wood will be removed from living and dead trees to measure overall growth, xylem cell anatomy, carbon in the wood, and production of defensive resins. Live twigs will be used to measure other traits related to water movement through the xylem. Cones produced by living pines will also be counted for several years to compare allocation to reproduction to amount of wood growth. These measurements will be combined to assess how growth relates to temperature and precipitation (climate) and how growth, xylem anatomy, and defense affect the chance that a tree will die in a drought, as well as whether these relationships differ between locations or species. These results will in turn be combined with the analysis of growth versus reproduction to identify which resource investment strategies work best under different drought scenarios, helping to identify conifer seed sources that will perform well under future climates. The project will provide research experience and training in the collection, processing, and/or analysis of dendrochronology and cell anatomy data for PhD students and undergraduates. The investigators will collaborate with the CalTeach program to develop learning modules that teach students about tree physiology and forest ecology while reinforcing other STEM skills.<br/><br/>The two drivers of tree mortality during drought that have received the most theoretical attention are hydraulic failure and carbon depletion/starvation, but biotic agents are also an important cause of death. This project will A) determine the relationships between tree radial growth, xylem anatomy, and resin duct production and drought-related mortality risk in seven species of Sierra Nevada conifers, B) confirm whether thicker xylem walls consistently embody more carbon resources, C) test whether there are tradeoffs between cone production and carbon investment and embolism resistance in the stem in pines, and D) model the lifetime fitness consequences of different levels of investment in overall growth, tracheid walls, resin ducts, and reproduction under different levels of drought stress. Examining multiple traits through a carbon-allocation lens will also enable connection of carbon allocation in the stem to potential tradeoffs with seed production.  Results will be an important step in modeling forest dynamics in drought-prone forests in a multigenerational eco-evolutionary manner. The findings of this study will help inform efforts to identify conifer seed sources that will perform well under future climates by providing evidence for the real-world consequences of traits such as hydraulic safety or resin production.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This critical trait allows many mosses to survive and reproduce even in drylands, and may be the key to their survival in the face of current, rapid climate change. Syntrichia is a large and diverse genus of mosses occurring worldwide and generally in dryland habitats. Despite their dominance in certain communities such as biological soil crusts, surprisingly little is known about the drivers of biodiversity in this clade. This interdisciplinary project integrates research from genomic, organismal, population, and community levels of organization in order to build a robust understanding of past and present dimensions of biodiversity in Syntrichia. The overall goals are to understand the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that have produced and maintained functional diversity at these different levels of organization, and promote training, teaching, and learning via: (1) formal education through field and laboratory research; (2) informal education involving a classroom module, short-film series featuring mosses and biocrusts transitioning from desiccation dormancy, a citizen science program ""Citizens of the Crust,"" and a series of free public workshops.<br/><br/>The research will examine tradeoffs between asexual and sexual reproduction, and between phenotypic plasticity and canalization into specialized genotypes, by examining the mechanisms underlying traits (including phenotypic plasticity) that drive diversification, reproduction, habitat selection, and physiological trait evolution in environments with varying degrees of water stress. Specific methods to be employed include: (1) sequencing the full genomes of S. caninervis and S. ruralis; (2) using next generation sequencing (NGS) to develop genotypic markers for population-level genetic variation studies, signature transcriptome tools for phenotypic analyses (related to ecophysiological and ecosystem investigations), and multiple single-copy genes for phylogenetic analysis; (3) transcriptomics experiments comparing different development stages and sexes of both species in response to desiccation stress and reproductive state; (3) ecophysiological experiments on multiple populations of S. caninervis and S. ruralis, and all 15 species of N.

This long-term experiment aims to address two key questions about tropical forest recovery.  First, the research compares natural forest recovery to two different forest restoration approaches (a low and high intensity approach) to assess how the degree of human intervention affects the rate of tropical forest recovery.  Second, the study evaluates the importance of the proximity of restored sites to remnant forest patches, which can serve as a source for colonizing plants and animals.  Results of this study will provide critical guidance to land managers and policy makers on how to most effectively invest limited resources to improve the outcomes of the millions of hectares of tropical forest restoration being undertaken globally. The study will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, and new inquiry-based learning program will actively engage high school students in the research. <br/><br/>Over a decade ago, 13 experimental sites were established over a 100 square kilometer area in southern Costa Rica, each site with a range of surrounding forest cover. Each site has three experimental treatments: 1. no tree planting and natural recovery; 2. planting tree islands of three sizes (low intensity); and 3. planting the entire plot with trees (high intensity). Researchers will collect data on metrics to assess the next phase of forest succession, including measuring soil nutrients, local microclimate, seed dispersal, tree growth, and the establishment and survival of forest seedlings.  In addition, plots will be used by collaborating scientists to study other facets of forest recovery such as insect community dynamics, and bird and bat behavior. The data will be used to address several questions about mid-stage forest recovery and how the pattern of recovery can change over time including: the effect of restoration interventions on within- and across-site biodiversity; the degree to which manipulations of initial conditions result in convergent or divergent successional trajectories from reference forest; and the relative importance of local- versus landscape-scale processes on forest recovery."

As research deconstruction requires no laboratory infrastructure, it offers a low-cost, scalable approach that may be accessible to a wide variety of institutions, including community colleges.  Engaging students in scientific inquiry is an important strategy for reducing attrition of students from STEM majors, a national problem that threatens the future of the U.S. as a global leader in science and technology.  Providing educators with sustainable options for inquiry-based instruction, particularly at 2-year colleges, may help to increase the number and diversity of future STEM professionals.<br/><br/>External assessment and STEM retention data from implementation over a 10-year period at suggest the approach is effective in teaching students the process of science and increasing persistence in STEM.  To determine the extent to which these educational benefits can be reproduced at a 2-year campus and identify adaptations necessary for implementation in a community college setting, the investigators will work with partner community colleges to develop a pilot research deconstruction course.  Formative assessment will be used to evaluate affective and cognitive learning gains and, in consultation with an advisory team of community college faculty, identify necessary adaptations for a second course offering.  These findings and those of network participants implementing research deconstruction at research universities will be shared at a workshop to identify best practices.  To increase awareness of the pedagogy, local STEM faculty will be invited to the workshop, and video recordings of the presentations will be posted on a website for distribution to the broader education community.  Outcomes from this incubator will inform future efforts as the network is expanded to include more 2- and 4-year colleges.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/)."

One way to predict the consequences of future climate change is to examine how vulnerable species have been affected by historical climatic patterns.  Collections of preserved specimens in natural history museums provide such a window into the past. New methods for extracting and sequencing DNA from these specimens open up exciting opportunities to reveal evolutionary changes in the western fence lizard over the last century.  This research examine specimens from two studies about 50 and 100 years ago. The lizards were collected at specific sites along a latitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. They will be compared with population samples from their modern day descendants. The DNA sequences will be paired with detailed 3D morphological scans of each specimen for analysis. The research will evaluate how population demographics in this species have changed through time. The analysis will reveal how populations have moved in response to a changing climate. It will assess which genes and traits are involved in local adaptation. A new research and learning experience will be developed using the data and workflow from this study to teach undergraduates critical skills in big data and scientific computing. This will be conducted through a program at UC Berkeley designed to address underrepresentation in all areas of data science.  Additionally, the data collected in this project will be used to develop an augmented reality educational game. The game will challenge high school student groups to collect and analyze data on the effects of climate change while exploring a real outdoor space.<br/><br/> Understanding how species will respond and adapt to non-stationary environmental change is a major challenge in modern biology. Research on population-level responses is critical for understanding how genetic diversity, population connectivity, and adaptive potential can be maintained in the face of ongoing climate change.  This project will conduct analyses at multiple scales to examine high resolution genomic and morphometric datasets that capture responses to climate change in natural populations across space and time.  These datasets will be built from contemporary collections of western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) paired with specimens collected from the same study area 50 years and 100 years ago and will be analyzed alongside environmental GIS data corresponding to each time period.  These longitudinal analyses of microevolutionary responses to climate change will address questions about the population-level effects of environmental change. Which genes and traits are involved in adaptation to climate change? How do changing environments affect population dynamics and genetic diversity? The results of this study will make available genomic and morphological data on one of the pioneering studies of local adaptation from a century ago, to the benefit of future students and researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These relatively simple multicellular organisms provide an excellent, cost-effective model system for studying fundamental aspects of developmental biology. Additionally, because these bacteria are relatively easy to modify genetically, and are capable of both converting sunlight into energy and providing a source of nitrogen-based fertilizer to certain plants, they are of considerable interest for development in biofuel production and agriculture. This project is focused on characterizing the genetic mechanism controlling the development of specialized filaments that are capable of movement, using the model strain Nostoc punctiforme. As part of the broader impacts, this project will also provide training for both undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the art genetic and molecular techniques, as well as an outreach program to local area schools which serve a diverse student body, many of whom are economically disadvantaged. Aspects of this project will be incorporated into teaching labs and several undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research, including students recruited from the Community Involvement Program (C.I.P.) at University of the Pacific, which serves first generation college students from ethnically underrepresented and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Students recruited from C.I.P. will be provided support for summer research assistantships and also participate in an outreach program for 5th-8th grade classrooms at local schools where they will disseminate a learning module using a portable fluorescence microscope to explore cell biology.<br/><br/>Filamentous cyanobacteria are among the most developmentally complex prokaryotes and the study of these organisms has provided valuable insight into developmental biology. Many species develop an array of specialized cell types including motile filaments termed hormogonia that facilitate dispersal. Hormogonia are also essential for the formation of supracellular structures and the establishment of nitrogen-fixing plant- and fungal-cyanobacterial symbioses that contribute significantly to global nitrogen fixation. Currently, the underlying molecular interactions controlling hormogonium development and ecologically important hormogonium-dependent processes are largely undefined. Based on recent studies and preliminary data, the working hypothesis is that hormogonium development is governed by a conserved gene regulatory network that includes sigma factors, partner-switching regulatory systems, the hmp chemotaxis system, and several additional uncharacterized components. This project has two specific aims: 1) Identify and characterize components of the gene regulatory network promoting hormogonium development, and 2) Define the role of sigma factors and partner-switching regulatory systems in hormogonium development. The project uses forward and reverse genetic approaches combined with a range of phenotypic analyses of mutant strains including morphological analyses and immunological assays of hormogonium-specific protein and polysaccharide expression, as well as transcriptomic studies to define the gene regulatory network promoting hormogonium development in the model filamentous cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme. Completion of this project will lay the foundation for a model of the gene regulatory network promoting hormogonium development that can then be used to rationally design genetically modified strains of filamentous cyanobacteria for various applications including biofuel production and novel plant-cyanobacterial symbioses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will resurvey field sites in the southwest United States last surveyed more than 70 years ago, which will not only advance our understanding of environmental changes but will establish a new benchmark for comparison of future changes. Federal land-management agencies will benefit from greater knowledge of the status of sensitive species and wildlife responses to climate change. Specimens and audio recordings collected will be available for ancillary studies. Results will be extended broadly to the public through talks, popular press and media, and museum displays, including new exhibits of the San Diego Natural History Museum and the Oakland Museum of California. The National Park Service Science and Education Office will distribute results widely through videos and podcasts to train their interpreters on the biological effects of environmental change and to provide interpretive materials for their visitor centers. Undergraduates, graduate student and postdoctoral researchers will participate in this study, learning field and lab techniques, natural history, physiological methods and modeling.

These areas have warmed greatly over the last 50 years, with the average annual temperatures increasing up to 2C. The research will advance understanding of animal responses to climate change by: developing new models that mechanistically project species' ranges by linking climate through important physiological thresholds of temperature and water stress; developing novel tests to examine whether climate change results in species shifting their geographic ranges individually or whether whole communities of species shift similarly; and testing if body sizes and diets of species have responded to climate change. Birds and mammals will be resurveyed at 105 sites. Both audio and physical voucher specimens will be collected and made available for future reanalysis. Standard morphological data will be collected for birds and mammal skulls. Ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes will be measured from tissues. Multispecies occupancy models will account for detectability in historical and current surveys to develop unbiased estimators of local colonization and extinction of species and changes in community composition in response to site-level characteristics. Measures of thermal and hydric stress at and above the upper limit of the thermal neutral zone will be made for 12 species of mammals to develop models of heat stress that can be validated."

A gateway  such as this helps  improve our understanding of how the brain works by making it easier for neuroscientists to use complex digital models of brain cells and circuits in their research. Powerful software has been developed for building and using models, and on-line resources such as Open Source Brain (OSB), ModelDB, Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF), and OpenWorm have been created to help neuroscientists find existing models, collaborate in developing new ones, and share the results of their work with others. However, models are becoming too complex for the computer hardware that is available to most neuroscientists, resulting in a critical need to use high performance computing resources (HPC). This work extends an existing Neuroscience Gateway (NSG), which was developed with support from NSF to eliminate or reduce many of the technical and administrative difficulties that previously limited neuroscientists' access to HPC (http://www.nsgportal.org/). That said, NSG users must still log in, upload models, launch simulations, and download results--a process that involves many time-consuming, error-prone steps. The expanded NSG-R will eliminate these steps by enabling on-demand, automated communication between itself and familiar working environments including resources like OSB and others mentioned above, and even with neural simulation software running on neuroscientists' own laptop and desktop computers. <br/><br/>This seamless access to HPC is implemented in NSG-R by a software infrastructure that uses REpresentational State Transfer (""REST"", the R in NSG-R). NSG-R utilizes set of web services which expose the capabilities of NSG for access via publicly available application programmer interfaces. This will allow users of neuroscience resources such as OSB, ModelDB, NIF and OpenWorm to readily access HPC from their respective websites via NSG-R. This enhances the usefulness of NSG-R, other neuroscience resources like OSB, and widely used neural simulators such as NEURON, GENESIS, PyNN, NEST, Brian and MOOSE. It also results in greater research productivity and enables wider use of large scale computational modeling by scientists and students. NSG-R will accelerate progress in brain science, and have far-reaching beneficial effects on related fields such as robotics and engineering of adaptive and learning systems. It will widen opportunities for educational and career advancement in neuroscience and engineering. Furthermore, by removing barriers that traditionally have limited access to HPC, NSG-R levels the playing field for all students and researchers regardless of their institutional affiliation. NSG-R, a free and open neuroscience gateway infrastructure, will naturally be a ready entry point for students and researchers from historically underrepresented schools and colleges. NSG-R workshops will be hosted at minority serving institutions (MSI) and opportunities for students to do internships with the NSG-R team at the University of California San Diego will be provided."

Anolis lizards (anoles) on the Greater Antillean islands in the Caribbean have undergone repeated adaptive evolution, resulting in the formation of different species on different islands that have evolved similar traits for occupying similar parts of the forest habitat.  This is a remarkable case of convergent evolution, in which separate species independently evolve similar traits, and ecological divergence, in which species diversify in response to the environment.  Thus, anoles present opportunities to answer several important questions, including what are the factors that produce diversity in the important ecological traits of a species?  What is the genetic basis for these traits, and are the same genes involved in the repeated evolution of particular traits in different species?  When do the processes generating variation lead to speciation, in which one species diversifies into multiple, distinct species?   This project will examine how spatial variation in the environment leads to variation in adaptive physical traits and variation across the genome both within and between species.  The researchers will use advanced methods in genetic, morphology, and spatial statistics to analyze individual animals from a dozen species of anoles collected across different environments.  By examining multiple species and many individual from each species, the researchers will be able to identify the factors that generate different levels of biodiversity during different stages of adaptive evolution.  This project will also result in the training of two postdoctoral researchers and numerous graduate and undergraduate students, including students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.  The researchers also plan to integrate the results of the project into classroom learning modules on the ecology and evolution of adaptive radiations for K-12 students.<br/><br/>Adaptive radiations, like the replicated diversification of Anolis lizards on the Greater Antilles into ecomorph classes through the evolution of novel traits, present excellent systems in which to study ecological divergence and parallel evolution. The overarching goal of the proposed research will be to examine how spatial environmental variation generates adaptive phenotypic diversity (Functional dimension), population genomic diversity (Genetic dimension), and ecomorphological species diversity (Phylogenetic dimension) in replicated adaptive radiations of Anolis lizards. Specifically, this project will test whether patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation depend upon the spatial structure of the environment or the ecology of the species; whether parallel phenotypic divergence involves parallel genetic divergence; whether environmental variation generates heterogeneous genomic divergence both within and between species; and whether the same regions of the genome are repeatedly involved in generating ecomorphological diversity. These questions will be answered by assembling ultra-high resolution environmental, morphological, and genetic datasets for 12 Anolis species from the Greater Antilles using cutting-edge data collection methods. This project will use terrestrial-LiDAR scans of structural habitats and geospatial analysis of bioclimatic layers in a GIS (Geographical Information System) to generate the environmental data, exon capture and whole exome sequencing to produce the genetic data, and micro-CT scanning to generate 3D reconstructions of field-collected specimens for the morphological data. Innovative analytical approaches will then be used to integrate these diverse datasets to understand the processes underlying diversification across different stages of adaptive radiation."

This goal has both applied and basic aspects. The applied goal is to develop and make freely available novel collections of reverse genetic resources that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. The basic goal is to analyze for the first time how a high copy TE rapidly diversifies the genome of an organism and, in doing so, alters its ability to respond to a changing environment. It is paradoxical that rice, with the most stable genome among characterized crop plants, is host to the most active TE characterized in any eukaryote.  This fortunate set of circumstances will facilitate the application of next generation sequencing methodologies to sequence related rice cultivars and survey global changes in gene expression associated with abiotic stress responses. To this end the project will resequence five closely related rice strains where mPing has amplified to over 1000 copies during the past century and where it is still actively transposing. Comparison with the closely related reference genome Nipponbare will document for the first time the global impact of independent TE bursts in any organism. To assess the consequences of mPing insertion(s) on quantitative traits, the project will exploit recombinant inbred (RI) populations where the parents vary widely in their copy number of mPing insertions and where significant phenotypic variation exists for many traits.  The contribution of candidate genes with mPing insertions to phenotypic variation will be assayed in transgenic rice. To exploit the full range of mPing amplification, from very low to very high, the project will activate mPing in US cultivars and create up to 1500 lines carrying novel mPing insertions through a non-transgenic approach.  Finally, the project will use expression profiling (RNA-seq) to examine the role of mPing in reshaping the leaf transcriptome in response to abiotic stress.<br/><br/>The expected broader impact of the project includes the development of novel collections of non-transgenic mPing-mutagenized rice strains that will be characterized from genome to transcriptome to phenome. All genomics data generated will be deposited at GenBank. Visualization of the datasets will be supported using in-house servers and at Gramene. All biological materials generated during the course of this project will be propagated at the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart (AR) and seed stocks of non-transgenic materials will be freely distributed through USDA-ARS Genetic Stocks - Oryza (GSOR) Collection. <br/><br/>All outreach activities will be channeled through the PI's ""The Dynamic Genome"" courses, which will be taught in a newly constructed Science Learning Facility at the University of California - Riverside.  These courses, which are designed to replicate the PI's research laboratory, will serve as a conduit that integrates the research output of this project with the development of classroom modules for colleges and high schools focused on next generation sequencing methodologies.  As such, these courses will bring the excitement of next-generation technologies to undergraduates and high school students and teachers.  Finally, project involvement in the iPlant Collaborative's Education Outreach Team will facilitate the broader dissemination of successful modules."

To continuously develop these organs throughout their lives, plants must maintain pools of stem cells - i.e., cells with the capacity to adopt numerous possible fates. Despite the differentiation of these stem cells into unique above-ground organs, these stem cell pools remain relatively constant. Precisely how plants (and other organisms) manage this delicate balance of stem cell maintenance and differentiation remains an important outstanding question in the field of biology. To further address this question, this project will use gene manipulation methods, biochemical analyses, and high-resolution live imaging to precisely describe how the gene expression processes that regulate this balance are controlled in plant stem cells. Understanding this delicate balance of stem cell maintenance and differentiation will facilitate the development of crop plants with optimal biomass and grain yield, as well as broadly provide new paradigms for gene regulation. Additionally, the dynamic live imaging of gene expression will be integrated into an outreach campaign aimed at explaining inquiry-based scientific learning techniques to high school students from lower income and Latino-dominated local area schools (http://cybersam.ucr.edu/Plone/lab-outreach-2). The project will additionally train a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student and several undergraduate students in methods and principles of gene regulation in actively developing tissues. <br/><br/>In Arabidopsis, WUSCHEL (WUS), a stem cell promoting transcription factor, moves from the rib meristem (RM) into the stem cell domain/central zone (CZ) where it represses transcription of differentiation promoting transcription factors and activates transcription of its own negative regulator-CLAVATA3 (CLV3) by directly binding the promoters. How WUS manages to activate CLV3 at a distance from the RM, and how it activates some genes and represses others is not understood. Unpublished work from the Gonehal Lab reveals that WUS binds several closely spaced cis-elements with different affinities (a cis-regulatory module [CRM]) in the CLV3 enhancer region as monomer and as dimer at lower and higher protein concentrations, respectively. The in vivo cis-element manipulations and manipulation of the WUS protein levels reveal that WUS utilizes the CRM to repress CLV3 at higher WUS concentration in the RM and activate at lower concentration in the CZ. This work aims to understand the regulation of spatio-temporal precision of CLV3 expression by understanding the mode and mechanism of action of the CLV3 CRM, characterize WUS binding cis-elements in a gene repressed by WUS and understand mechanisms of concentration-dependent transcriptional discrimination through functional analysis of putative co-factors that interact with WUS. This activity will lead to a new paradigm in transcriptional regulation in plants and in concentration-dependent transcriptional regulation in general. Insights obtained from this work will facilitate comparative analysis of transcriptional regulation in shoot and root stem cell niches."

Typically, plants can only use atmospheric N can when fixed by microbes that live in the soil or via a symbiotic relationship with legumes, but recent findings indicate that bacteria inside pine needles can also perform this critical function. In this research, investigators at University of California, Merced will examine the symbiosis between bacteria and limber pine (Pinus flexilis). The goals are to understand the diversity of bacteria present in pine needles, calculate how much N microbes fix and under what conditions, and infer how this fixed N is transferred to the tree. The research could significantly improve our understanding of the N cycle and help identify a currently unknown source of fixed N within coniferous forests. A more complete understanding of the N cycle will also help improve climate models, and a better characterization of the microbes that can fix Nitrogen could lead to advances in crop development. This research will train undergraduates. graduate students and post-doctoral researchers in both field and lab techniques. Additionally, the research will include outreach to teachers, administrators and students at a K-8 STEM school serving under-represented groups, and will develop inquiry-based learning modules in line with Common Core educational standards for incorporation within the K-8 STEM curriculum.<br/><br/>The investigators will examine how the phylogenetic diversity and genetic potential of subalpine tree endophytes affect N fixation within western coniferous forests. Their central hypothesis is that across its broad geographic range, limber pine hosts a broad taxonomic, genetic and functional biodiversity of mutualistic N fixing endophytes, shaped by the local environment, and shared, in part, with neighboring trees. To test this, investigators will examine the biodiversity of endophytes in limber pine and co-occurring species across the limber pine range, identify the factors that structure the patterns of diversity, and determine the relationship between taxonomic diversity and N fixation. Cutting-edge methods in sequencing and genome analysis will be integrated with established and highly sensitive methods for detecting and visualizing N fixing activity in situ to understand how endophyte diversity is shaped by the environment and shapes the N cycle in subalpine forests."

This research will resurvey field sites in the southwest United States last surveyed more than 70 years ago, which will not only advance our understanding of environmental changes but will establish a new benchmark for comparison of future changes.

These areas have warmed greatly over the last 50 years, with the average annual temperatures increasing up to 2C. The research will advance understanding of animal responses to climate change by: developing new models that mechanistically project species' ranges by linking climate through important physiological thresholds of temperature and water stress; developing novel tests to examine whether climate change results in species shifting their geographic ranges individually or whether whole communities of species shift similarly; and testing if body sizes and diets of species have responded to climate change. Birds and mammals will be resurveyed at 105 sites. Both audio and physical voucher specimens will be collected and made available for future reanalysis. Standard morphological data will be collected for birds and mammal skulls. Ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes will be measured from tissues. Multispecies occupancy models will account for detectability in historical and current surveys to develop unbiased estimators of local colonization and extinction of species and changes in community composition in response to site-level characteristics.

Speciation?the formation of new species? can proceed when two groups of organisms no longer recognize each other as mates due to differences in relevant traits such as behavior (e.g., songs) or appearance (e.g., coloration). This research quantifies the behavioral and neural mechanisms that mediate female mate recognition and preference to understand how speciation proceeds. Researchers will measure female response to males from differentiated populations of the same species (pre-speciation stage) and to males of two closely related species (post-speciation stage), thus spanning a continuum of species-level differentiation. Researchers will first conduct behavioral studies to identify the strength and role of relevant traits in courtship and mating success at each stage. Next, female response will be linked to activation patterns in the regions of the brain associated with visual, acoustic and courtship processing. Examination of neural de-activation patterns in the courtship region of the brain along the speciation continuum addresses a gap in knowledge of whether speciation proceeds gradually or abruptly. This research builds upon 17 years of genetic and behavioral studies of the Neotropical red-eyed treefrog, Agalychnis callidryas, to understand the mechanisms and processes of early-stage speciation. It supports diverse students to experience science in the field and in the lab, and creates active-learning content for ~120 students in an enrichment program at the K5 grade level (82% underserved minority, 60% Free/Reduced Lunch). Finally, this research fosters international collaboration between U.S. and Costa Rican research biologists.<br/><br/>This collaborative research provides new and exciting insights into the evolution of signal divergence, female recognition and neural activity patterns, and the consequences of these factors for premating reproductive isolation and speciation. This research has two specific aims. Aim 1 examines female response to divergent cues through both female preference assays and neural activation patterns to test whether incremental increases in trait divergence result in a continuous or all-or-none neural response. Aim 2 tests how mismatched cues alter neural activity response patterns, addressing whether mismatched cues weaken/break courtship response. Neural response will be measured using immunohistochemistry and microscopy. Combined, these two aims identify how the trait(s) that are important for stimulating courtship behavior modulate neural activity function, and thus provide mechanistic insight into how premating reproductive isolation evolves. Computational modeling will explore the dynamic relationship among signal differentiation and female response (behavior and neural activity) using simulated data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They function as members of microbial communities that consume decaying plant and animal material and convert it back into the starting materials needed for photosynthesis by plants and algae. The syntrophic bacteria first break down and recycle small organic molecules such as fats, amino acids and small aromatic compounds. The resulting waste products (vinegar, water and hydrogen gas) are then used by a second group of microbes called methanogens to generate more water plus carbon dioxide and methane. Methane can be harvested and used as a renewable energy supply. Through this cooperation, both microbes obtain energy to survive and grow in environments where neither could alone. A combination of molecular and biochemical tools is used to study the previously undescribed metabolism in each microbe and to understand how they cooperate with one another to optimally recycle waste materials in nature.  The enzymes used in substrate conversion will be identified and characterized; and how cells accomplish the exchange of metabolites will be examined. The new knowledge will assist in modeling and predicting how carbon is recycled in different environments, as well as how these processes affect the normal maintenance of the earth's biosphere.  Furthermore, it will improve our ability to recycle unwanted waste materials into renewable energy supplies.  In outreach activities, web-based learning materials will be generated and used to enhance undergraduate microbiology instruction at both institutions. In addition, the PIs will perform outreach activities in several under-developed countries to facilitate the development of locally sustainable applications for waste treatment and energy production.<br/><br/>Syntrophic metabolism is essential in nearly all anaerobic ecosystems, yet very little is understood about the molecular, biochemical, or physiological events that drive the associated ecological transformations. Here, microbial communities composed of distinct species of bacteria and archaea operate in metabolic balance to drive global carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning. The PIs hypothesize that specialized biochemical and adaptive systems are used by the syntrophic partners to accomplish their community-driven metabolism. To examine this, the model Syntrophomonas wolfei/Methanosprillum hungatei co-culture system will be employed to elucidate basic principles governing formation and maintenance of the syntrophic partnership. A combination of high-throughput technologies, including genome-wide proteomic profiling and genetic two hybrid screens, will be employed to identify the metabolic and regulatory networks involved in fatty acid catabolism.  This will be followed by the biochemical characterization of key proteins needed for carbon oxidation and electron flow down to the formation of H2 and CO2 which is a thermodynamically difficult process. The molecular events required to establish and maintain a related but distinct co-culture partnership, that between S. wolfei and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium will also be examined. The resulting information will provide a foundation to model and predict related processes by other multispecies microbial communities.  The new knowledge will be used to develop innovative solutions for waste treatment and energy production and to engineer bio-methanation and microbial fuel systems to provide locally sustainable applications for wastewater treatment.   <br/><br/>This award is jointly funded by the Cellular Dynamics and Function and the Systems and Synthetic Biology Programs in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding why animal signals are so complex and how they evolved is a major research focus for scientists in many fields. Such research can add to our knowledge about how the senses work, how attention and learning shift perception, and how changing environments can impact communication (among others). In this project, scientists from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Auburn University use a systems approach to study the evolution of courtship displays in a well-developed animal system. The team uses genomics to reconstruct the evolutionary history of more than 23 species. For each species, they also describe the communication system in detail and how it changes with environmental conditions. They then test hypotheses about system properties such as robustness and flexibility/evolvability. The project will advance our understanding of complex animal signals, and test long-standing theories from engineering and genomics about system structure and function. The project involves the training of undergraduate and graduate students. Research findings will also be integrated into a science exhibit that will be made available to the general public at natural history museums in Nebraska and Alabama. <br/><br/>Despite an appreciation of the prevalence and importance of complex signals in animal communication, progress towards an evolutionary analysis of signal complexity has been constrained by a lack of hypotheses and tools that can compare signaling systems across taxa and assess evolutionary and functional implications. This project develops and tests a novel theoretical and empirical paradigm by integrating a systems approach into animal communication research using Schizocosa wolf spiders. North American Schizocosa include 23 species that vary in their use of vibratory and visual courtship displays. Specific aims are (1) to assess the structure and dynamics of vibratory and visual courtship signals of each species in different environments; (2) to generate a robust phylogeny; and (3) to use phylogenetic comparative methods to test (i) the hypothesis that degeneracy facilitates robustness across changing conditions and (ii) whether degeneracy facilitates (or constrains) elaboration and signal divergence. The simultaneous measures of vibratory and visual signals across contexts combined with a robust phylogeny will enable unparalleled opportunities for evolutionary analyses of complexity. This research will facilitate an integrative and comprehensive understanding of the evolution, diversification, and maintenance of complex animal communication and provide a roadmap for similar studies across distinct taxa and signaling systems."

Thus, many aspects of ""egg quality"", the term used to describe an egg that can be successively fertilized and lead to a viable offspring, are determined relatively early. The project will use ovaries from a non-mammalian vertebrate model to determine how early oocyte growth is regulated by hormones. Because of the conserved nature of egg development in vertebrates, the research will improve fundamental knowledge of egg development in vertebrates, including humans and agriculturally important animals, and may lead to the development of improved methods to overcome reproductive dysfunction of captive-reared fish in conservation and commercial aquaculture. The project will integrate research and education by recruiting undergraduate and graduate students from California State University Fullerton, a Hispanic Serving Institution, to work with a diverse group of scientists from the University of Washington, and with researchers from a federal agency. The goal is to train the next generation of scientists how to apply molecular tools, bioinformatics, and histology to biological questions while gaining an in-depth understanding of animal physiology, endocrinology, and reproduction. The research will be presented to the scientific community and to the public via established partnerships to provide trainees with service-learning experience.<br/><br/>The basic physiology of female teleost reproduction, particularly during the later stages of oogenesis (e.g., vitellogenesis, maturation, ovulation) is fairly well understood. By contrast, comparatively little is known about the transition into puberty. In the ovary, this occurs when the primary growth ovarian follicles (containing developing oocytes) are recruited into secondary growth. Using a well-characterized in vitro model using coho salmon ovarian explants, the investigators have shown that 11-ketotestosterone (11KT), a teleost-specific aromatizable androgen, promotes the development of primary and early secondary ovarian follicles, associated with identification via RNA-Seq of altered mRNA levels of hundreds to thousands of genes, depending on stage. These changes are consistent with altered hormonal signaling pathways, tissue remodeling, and the progression to an early secondary ovarian follicle phenotype. The project will further explore the hypothesis that androgens are essential for early ovarian follicle by exploiting advances in proteomics, quantitative steroid biochemical analyses and the availability of homologous recombinant gonadotropins to: characterize the major endogenous androgens present in the female coho salmon during the onset of puberty; characterize androgen receptors; document the development-related changes in ovarian follicle proteins using cutting-edge proteomics; and explore the potential roles of gonadotropins in regulating previtellogenic ovarian follicle development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, making use of this information in applications such as medicine and agriculture requires additional work to determine the functions of these proteins-what they do at the molecular and organism levels.  The first step in determining function of a new protein is to compare its sequence to other proteins whose functions have been analyzed experimentally.  Under previous funding,  computational methods for reconstructing the evolutionary history of each group of related proteins developed and this history was used to suggest functions that have been conserved during evolution and provide the starting point for protein function analysis. The next step in this work is to enable application to the millions of protein sequences available, and to extend the method to include more detailed information about protein function.  This project will develop and test a practical, production-grade implementation of our method, and apply it to UniProt, the world's largest database of protein sequences.  UniProt is publicly available, so results will be broadly available and usable by both scientists and non-scientists alike.  Educational materials will be developed to help make the results more accessible to students and non-scientists.<br/><br/>The UniProt protein knowledgebase aims to maximize the utility of protein sequence data to the scientific community by representing not only the sequences themselves, but also annotations: metadata describing information that can be inferred about those sequences, such as predicted protein function.  The current approach to large-scale annotation of UniProt, called UniRule, relies on ad hoc rules to define sets of proteins that should be annotated similarly.  While these rules implicitly utilize information about evolutionary relationships (e.g. membership in a protein family), they do not model function evolution explicitly and are therefore limited in the specificity of annotations they can express.  This project implements an explicit evolutionary approach to large-scale sequence annotation, building upon previous work 1) on evolutionary modeling of gain and loss of protein functions (represented as terms from the Gene Ontology) in gene families, and 2) on software to reconstruct the evolutionary history any arbitrary protein sequence by placing it in the context of a phylogenetic tree. Production-level implementation of this approach within the UniProt resource will integrate the large-scale annotation systems already used in the UniProt and Gene Ontology projects, and result in increased specificity and coverage of annotations in the UniProt knowledgebase. The project will significantly improve annotations on tens of millions of sequences in the UniProt knowledgebase, impacting the massive UniProt user base. It will also provide the annotations for Gene Ontology-based analyses of the large number of fully sequenced genomes in UniProt, making such analyses more broadly available.  A new online educational module for protein function evolution will curate a learning path starting with this module and including other available online modules.  The results will be available in the UniProt resource (uniprot.org), and all software and annotation metadata will be available at pantree.org.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most mutations in genes that are required for bone elongation produce a proportionately dwarfed skeleton. Scientists know very little about how a bone's growth rate is locally determined to be faster or slower than other bones in the skeleton. By comparing gene expression differences in two rodents with very different skeletons, the mouse and bipedal jerboa with extremely long feet, the Cooper laboratory identified a number of genes that are excellent candidates to control growth rate differences within and between species. The project detailed in this NSF CAREER award will take advantage of the ability to quickly and easily over-express genes in the developing chicken skeleton to test the prediction that 30 of these candidate genes, which are not known to control skeletal development, are each sufficient to increase or decrease bone growth rate. The methods to visualize and analyze these manipulated skeletons are ideally suited to engage high school students in hands-on research experience. This project is therefore designed to provide a potentially transformative learning opportunity for hundreds of ""at risk"" students in an under-served community, in addition to expanding knowledge of the genetic control of skeletal growth and proportion. <br/><br/>The Cooper laboratory has capitalized on the striking difference in hindlimb proportions of the mouse and bipedal jerboa, similarity of their forelimbs, and the relatively close phylogenetic relationship (last common ancestor ~55 million years ago) to identify genes by RNA-Seq with expression differences that robustly associate with relative growth rates. These genes form a predicted interaction network that is highly enriched for pathways that are known to influence skeletal growth (e.g. WNT, Notch, and proteoglycan signaling), though many of the individual genes that were identified have no known growth plate function. They will focus on a set of 30 genes that show the strongest evidence for modular expression in the limb skeleton; gene expression changed during the evolution of accelerated elongation of the jerboa foot and remained unchanged in the forelimb that grows similar to mouse. In order to identify causative mechanisms that modulate skeletal growth rate, the lab will implement a powerful retroviral mis-expression system in the developing chicken wing skeleton to test the hypothesis that each gene is sufficient to accelerate or inhibit skeletal elongation. The objectives will rapidly expand what is known of the molecular toolkit that controls skeletal proportion and will contribute to mapping modular enhancers that control growth plate-specific gene expression and thus the development and evolution of skeletal proportion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will utilize biological collections in innovative ways.  When hybridization occurs (the exchange of genetic information) between two species, genetic variants (known as alleles) that originated in one species may be introduced into another species. Evidence from DNA sequencing in vertebrates so far suggests that most introduced alleles are removed by natural selection. However, sometimes introduced alleles are beneficial and impact important traits like pesticide-resistance and coat color. Understanding the role of natural selection to eliminate or promote introduced alleles is essential to learning how wild populations adapt to their environments, but this has not been well studied. In this project, the fellow will identify introduced alleles and genes related to environmental adaptation in two closely-related bird species that hybridized historically. If alleles related to environmental adaptation in one species are found in the other, this will reveal a positive role for selection on introduced alleles. By using new sequencing techniques, working with undergraduates and creating an online educational lesson, the fellow will develop skills required to succeed as a researcher and teacher.<br/><br/> To examine the dual role of natural selection on introduced alleles, the fellow will characterize selection and introgression in two species with different colonization histories to high elevation. The lack of environmental oxygen (hypoxia) at high elevation presents a chronic selective pressure on residents with high metabolic rates like birds, and many species that occupy high elevation possess derived genetic adaptations. The fellow previously documented genome-wide introgression between the Bolivian Hooded siskin, a recent colonist to high elevation, and the Black siskin, a high elevation specialist, as well as directional introgression of two high-elevation associated loci. With this framework, the fellow will test for evidence of adaptive introgression genome-wide in the Bolivian Hooded siskin. To examine if natural selection has favored the introgression of high-elevation adapted alleles into the Bolivian Hooded siskin, the fellow will (1) test if a disproportionate number of alleles with Black-siskin ancestry in the Bolivian Hooded siskin are in genes associated with hypoxia adaptation, and (2) if these hypoxia-related genes from the Black siskin bear a signature of positive selection in the Bolivian Hooded siskin.

Despite enormous efforts invested into characterizing molecular interactions, their complexities make it very difficult to predict and manipulate cellular responses to environmental and genetic perturbations. This project aims to elucidate the strategies by which cells achieve ""dimensional reduction"", i.e., how cells themselves manage to reduce the multiplicity of molecular information and direct simple coherent behaviors. The specific topic will be on bacteria growth, with focus on how a bacterium cell determines how fast it grows and how it uses this information to coordinate metabolism and gene expression. Student and post-doctoral researchers supported by this grant will learn to make molecular and behavioral characterization, develop mathematical models to relate these measurements, and test specific hypotheses on the mechanism of dimensional reduction. The lessons learned will be integrated into the graduate-level curriculum in Quantitative Biology being developed by the PI, both for students of biological sciences to learn the mathematics of dimensional reduction and for students of physical sciences to learn different types of experiments to characterize molecular interactions and behaviors. <br/><br/>This research program will focus on the ppGpp signaling system underlying growth control of E. coli as a specific molecular system implementing dimensional reduction. From known qualitative features of ppGpp-based control in E. coli, a quantitative model of growth control is proposed based on both positive and negative regulation of protein synthesis via ppGpp signaling.  This research program will test and elucidate the details of this ppGpp-based mode of growth control, probe its dependences on key components of the signaling and control circuit which set its few parameters, and determine its consequences on the kinetics growth transitions by E. coli, from one exponential growth state to another through periods of growth arrest.

Iron is an essential nutrient that is actively acquired by bacteria from human hemoglobin during infections. A key step in microbial iron acquisition is the extraction of iron-laden heme from hemoglobin. Using biophysical and computational approaches the investigators will learn how the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus uses the IsdH surface receptor to extract heme from hemoglobin. This process is clinically important, as it enables methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) to cause infections. The results of this work will provide a detailed view of the mechanism underlying extraction and it will have a broad impact as other bacterial pathogens also use a similar mechanism to acquire iron during infections.  The proposal will facilitate undergraduate and graduate student outreach programs of students from under-represented groups at the PhD level. The grant will be used to support outreach efforts to community college students and promote diversity, inclusion, and the elimination of barriers to participation in bioscience research careers.<br/><br/>In this project a team of investigators will apply computational and experimental methodologies to decipher the structural, dynamic and energetic basis through which the Staphylococcus aureus IsdH protein extracts heme from human hemoglobin (Hb). This process is highly conserved and used by many bacterial species to obtain the essential nutrient iron. Recent structural data and newly developed experimental tools make IsdH a powerful model system in which to explore the heme extraction mechanism. The overall goal of this research project is to elucidate how heme is transferred from Hb to IsdH, and to learn how this process is facilitated by inter-domain motions. In Aim #1, simulations and experiments will define the pathway of heme transfer, and uncover specific receptor contacts that facilitate transfer and distort Hb to trigger heme release. In Aim #2, the role of inter-domain motions will be determined by quantitatively assessing their effect on the local concentration of the receptor, and the kinetics and thermodynamics of transfer. Because IsdH is paradigmatic, the results of this project will provide broad insight into the extraction mechanisms used by a wide-range of bacteria."

When eukaryotic cells divide, they generate the spindle apparatus that ensures the faithful segregation of the genetic material into two daughter cells.  This biological machinery is assembled by the cytoskeletal filaments of microtubules.  Spindles often have their poles defined by two centrosomes in organisms like fungi and animals.  During evolution, however, the centrosome is no longer produced in flowering plants.  Yet these spindles lacking this structure can still precisely exercise their essential function in cell division.  This research is aimed at understanding the roles of proteins that regulate the formation of the spindle microtubule array in plants.  The knowledge learned from spindle assembly in plants also will illuminate how cell division is executed in other organisms.  The work will involve the participation of both undergraduate and graduate students.  High school students will also have an opportunity to participate in the research during the summers.  <br/><br/>This project aims to understand mechanisms that regulate acentrosomal spindle microtubule organization in plants by employing two model systems, the basal liverwort Marchantia polymorpha in which the centrosome is present but not always used in mitosis and the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana that lacks the structure.  Preliminary studies in A. thaliana were focused on the mitotic kinase of Aurora (alphaAur) and its regulator TPXL3, the microtubule nucleator of the gamma-tubulin ring complex (gammaTuRC), and the Kinesin-14 motors of ATK1 and ATK5 that are associated with spindle MTs.  When functions of these proteins were compromised, spindles failed to establish convergent poles, and ultimately mutant plants showed severe defects in both vegetative growth and reproduction.  The working hypothesis is that alphaAur regulates the functions of gammaTuRC and Kinesin-14 in spindle assembly.  Specifically, the formation of mitotic spindles with convergent poles requires Kinesin-14-dependent microtubule organization and poleward accumulation of gammaTuRC.  This hypothesis will be tested by employing 1) imaging techniques to determine the actions of essential regulators of spindle microtubule organization during mitosis; 2) genetic tools to dissect functions of targeted proteins; and 3) biochemical methods to learn how their functions are regulated.  In vitro and in vivo results garnered from these studies will contribute to<br/>elucidating mechanisms that regulate acentrosomal spindle assembly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Population genomics (the study of diversity in the genomic DNA of populations instead of individuals) has important applications in agriculture, anthropology, conservation, medicine, and several other fields of biology. Recent technology advances have greatly lowered the cost of DNA sequencing so large amounts of data are available. At the same time statisticians have developed new methods for analyzing large collections of genome-sized data. Combining the data with the new analysis approaches can let scientists answer fundamental questions about the biology of species that have never before been accessible. However, most population genomics studies fail to take advantage of the latest population genomics statistical methods. This is because the genomic data requires a lot of processing to prepare it for the analysis steps, and these operations are not easy to learn. Lack of bioinformatics knowledge has led to erroneous conclusions, irreproducible results, incomplete analyses, and slow turnaround time of population genomics projects. This project aims to provide software that can handle those tasks in a consistent and correct way and allow direct access to the statistical tools, to bring about new insights in population biology. <br/><br/>This project will address the largest impediments to model-based population genomics by building a user-friendly and intuitive pipeline platform, the ""Pop-gen Pipeline Platform"" (PPP). This platform will help researchers avoid the problems inherent in re-inventing data processing scripts to feed data into their population genomics analyses, and considerably reduce time and effort. PPP will include tested scripts and pipelines for data preparation, and in addition the tools needed to build evolutionary models, carry out analyses of data, and create visualization of results via the Ruffus Computation Pipeline Library in Python. PPP will also be developed as a stand-alone application with a graphical user interface (GUI) under the popular and robust Galaxy Project (www.galaxyproject.org) for bioinformatics analyses. An online server deploying Galaxy/PPP will be developed and maintained at Temple University, Philadelphia (www.dev3.cst.temple.edu) for users to interactively submit jobs on a first-come-first-served basis. Online forums will be established for support, and to collect suggestions regarding what is desired for further development under PPP. Tutorials and videos about example applications of the PPP will be added to the Galaxy Project Wikipedia training channels. Additionally, a significant part of this work will involve educating Temple University seniors, Philadelphia area high school teachers, and their students about the power of bioinformatics in modern biology through summer workshops.

New small and light-weight microscopes have been developed that can be carried on the heads of laboratory mice and rats. These microscopes take advantage of new probes that sense calcium levels and flash bright when a brain cell becomes active. The Neuronex Neurotechnology Hub has built new miniature microscopes that not only sense light but can also directly record the electrical activity of the large numbers of cells deep in the brain. This combination of electrical and optical recordings gives scientists the new ability to read out how large groups of brain cells and brain regions work together as the brain senses, learns, plans and executes actions. The Neuronex Neurotechnology Hub will also create new computer systems that can analyze these activity patterns extremely quickly (within small fractions of a second). This rapid feedback system will allow investigators to rapidly probe how the activity of specific groups of brain cells is linked to each behavior. Finally, the Hub will build and test a new miniature microscope called a ""light field miniature microscope"".  This version of the microscope will allow investigators to make 3-D movies of brain activity, greatly improving their view of the large network of brain cells. All these technologies will be openly shared with neuroscience community through a website (miniscope.org), such that each laboratory can build each of these devices themselves at very low cost. The Hub will hold workshops to teach scientists how to build and use the various devices. Finally the hub will reach out to the broader community by holding classes for K-12 and college students, and demonstrating how these devices can give us a view of brain function.<br/><br/>This Neurotechnology Hub will develop and share next-generation miniaturized in vivo sensing devices that integrate optical and electrophysiological recording from hundreds or thousands of neurons in behaving animals. These devices will be coupled with energy-efficient computing hardware for real-time signal processing and closed-loop feedback capabilities. The Hub will also create light field miniaturized microscopes that will allow three dimensional optical recordings of network activity in freely behaving animals. Last, the Hub will manufacture and distribute custom made, 3 dimensional silicon microprobes for large scale electrophysiological recordings. Making these devices widely available for neuroscience research and teaching will have significant broader impacts, by accelerating discovery and broadening outreach.  The  devices and techniques will be distributed widely to a large community of researchers, as previously done with the open-source miniaturized microscope developed by the PIs (the website at miniscope.org already has >2500 registered users and >250 labs using our microscope), as well as with silicon microprobes (>100 devices have been shared with users). Hence, the Hub will have a broad impact upon neuroscience research, facilitating many future advances in our understanding of the neural basis for emotion, cognition, and behavior, with a high potential to catalyze major new discoveries. The PIs will establish an outreach program through partnership with the Minority Access to Research Careers program at UCLA, as well as the UCLA Center for Excellence in Engineering and Diversity (CEED), to involve highly diversified high school and undergraduate students in this research.

Twenty-eight Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites are distributed in habitats across the nation and in the tropical Pacific. Research at each site provides important system-specific knowledge whereas integrating across sites fosters the discovery of wide-spread patterns of ecosystem functioning and general ecological theory. This project expands on the coordination, communication, training, and synthetic research activities across the network of Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites that were initiated while first supported as the LTER National Communications Office. The Office facilitates connections among LTER sites across multiple dimensions, including hypothesis development, experimental design, measurement protocols, data management, collaboration, communications training, education at all levels, and outreach. The office supports shared governance and collaborative relationships within the LTER network and strong ties with partner networks that are valuable for expanding the reach and implications of LTER research. LTER sites train a large fraction of the nation's ecologists in interdisciplinary team science and an important subset of activities focuses on developing and sharing best practices for inclusion and assessment.<br/><br/>The LTER Network Office maintains and improves upon most of the activities of the current LNCO, but with some re-organization and re-prioritization based on lessons learned during the first 4 years of operation. The office remains cost-efficient through affiliation with NCEAS, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, and by supporting virtual meetings for synthesis research and committee activities whenever appropriate. To engage the long-term research community, the team continues to develop the LTER network website, newsletters, and social media platforms. New tools to facilitate collaboration include a redesigned centralized personnel database, collaboration platform, and cumulative catalogue of LTER products. A central facet of the project is support for multiple synthesis working groups selected by a rigorous panel process and appropriately inclusive of terrestrial, coastal and marine scientists and perspectives. Working groups are provided training and support in open data practices and team science. Engaging partner networks such as the International LTER network (ILTER), Critical Zone Observatories (CZO), and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is also a high priority for the office.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, every time a tennis player returns a serve, conditions are different from those the player has experienced in the past: the ball is travelling at a slightly different speed, or at a different angle, or with a different rotation. Yet, the nervous system is able to generate a response that is effective under these novel conditions. How is this possible? This project will address this question by combining new mathematical methods with a novel experimental system that uses real-time computer vision to track animals as they solve sequential decision tasks. As part of the broader impacts of the study, the investigators will partner with an undergraduate education program intended to introduce research opportunities to traditionally underrepresented STEM students. Interdisciplinary teams of students will be mentored in developing and executing small research projects related to the theme of the larger project with the goal providing a gateway for both basic science majors, and also engineering and mathematics majors into cutting-edge, interdisciplinary science. In addition, the investigators will incorporate this research when mentoring participants in the University of Florida's longstanding Whitney Lab REU program (31 years). The results of this work will shed light on how animals generate such a diverse range of behaviors to survive in novel situations, and will lead to new questions and approaches that can be used to understand the function of the vertebrate nervous system and the origins of behavioral control in some of the most important tasks animals undertake.<br/><br/>Unlike binary choice tasks, which have long served as the model for animal decision-making, more complex sensory-motor behaviors such as avoiding predators or capturing prey often involve sequences of decisions made in response to dynamic streams of sensory stimuli. A key requirement of such behaviors is that they be robust. For example, the exact chain of decisions required to escape a predator will differ from one setting to another, yet an animal must generate a sequence of responses uniquely suited to the situation at hand. This highlights a perennial question about animal behavior: how can behaviors that are learned or evolved in one context generalize to the enormous set of possible situations an animal might encounter? This project attacks this question using a combination of mathematical modeling and high-resolution, closed loop experiments using the prey attack and predator evasion behaviors of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as a model for studying how animals generate flexible, robust behavioral sequences. In particular, the investigators will test the emerging hypothesis that these robust, higher-level behavioral responses are achieved through a mechanism called behavioral gain control. Research will explore how behavioral gain control is involved in initiating behavioral sequences at the right time, balancing multiple competing objectives, coordinating control along multiple behavioral dimensions (e.g., acceleration, turning), and maintaining performance across changing environmental conditions. This work has the potential to shed new light on how complex behaviors are generated in the context of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Globally, fish are second only to swine for animal protein production. Aquaculture, fish farming, is the fastest growing agricultural sector in the world with both fresh and saltwater fish as major components. One of the distinguishing factors of fish from other vertebrates is the utilization of gills. In addition to respiration, fish use gills for gas and waste exchange. Gills cover a large surface area and are also the home to many microorganisms including eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and viruses collectively known as the microbiome. Understanding the relationship between the gill microbiome and the host physiology is critical for fish health. This research will identify the consequences of microbial communities that reside in the gill of the fish and provide ways to manipulate these communities for the benefit of the fish through host genetics and microbial communities. The study will allow an ideal educational interface with outreach activities (science communication) that include tours with underrepresented minority elementary school students. <br/>   <br/>Specifically, this research will use multi-omic methods such as genome sequencing, microbiome sequencing, and transcriptomics to evaluate the genomic landscape of the fish gill. The Fellow has collected 100 local fish species from Southern California, representing 25% of the total marine diversity and will sequence and compare the fish genomes and gill microbiomes. The proposal seeks to achieve the following objectives: (1) quantify environmental and biological (host) factors regulating gill microbiome development, (2) investigate microbial spatial distribution in fish gills across tuna, mackerels and fast swimming pelagic species, and (3) compare microbial biofouling impacts on metabolic rate in mackerel, a model Scrombrid (Scomber japonicus). By developing methods to knock out and knock in the microbiome of the fish gill, the Fellow will then evaluate how microbial density or biofouling negatively affects respiration. Future research from this project could use these data to develop probiotics or therapeutics to enhance gill health. The Fellow will learn methods in comparative fish genomics, transcriptomics, and physiology, building upon prior experience in microbiome research while promoting outreach specifically with teaching these concepts to LMIC and underserved communities through workshops.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports research and training of the Fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. Many living things benefit each other, and these relationships often involve multiple species. Why are these interactions not specialized on a single ?best? partner? This research proposes a new Rule of Life to explain this paradox: Portfolio effects, predicting that diverse partners exist because no single partner is the ?best? under all conditions. Like investors, organisms may need a broad portfolio of relationships, in case the environment changes. This project examines portfolio effects in the ectomycorrhizal mutualism, required by roughly 60% of trees. Ectomycorrhizal plants feed sugars to dozens of fungi on their roots in exchange for nutrients and water. Since trees live for decades, they must withstand environmental variation, from winter storms to droughts. Their fungi may offer different symbiotic benefits in these environments. Thus, trees may need to maintain fungal diversity over time. This research tests for portfolio effects in seedling recruitment, to improve predictions for how forests will respond to environmental variation. This research will also train undergraduate researchers underrepresented in ecology, and will support public lectures and a science workshop for middle school students.<br/><br/>This project combines greenhouse experiments, gene expression analysis, and mathematical modeling to investigate portfolio effects. The Fellow will use Douglas fir and fungal cultures to understand how symbiotic fungal function varies under stress. The stressors tested ? drought and nitrogen pollution ? represent likely future environmental conditions in many forests. The Fellow will measure how well tree seedlings tolerate stress when associated with each fungus, and will measure fungal gene expression across environments, connecting genomes to phenotypes. Then, a statistical model will simulate how well a population of seedlings associated with the tested fungi would withstand a stressful growing season. Portfolio effects predict that populations of seedlings with more diverse symbionts will grow and survive more consistently. Finally, an eco-evolutionary model will examine how specialized a plant lineage will become, depending upon how frequently the environment shifts.

The fellow, Jaaved Mohammed, is conducting research and receiving training that is increasing the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The fellow is being mentored by Dr. Joanna Wysocka at Stanford University. The goal of this research project is to characterize craniofacial mutations (those of the head and face), and to understand their impact at the molecular level. The head and face are remarkably distinctive organs that set humans apart from each other and from other species.  Enhancers are a class of DNA elements that play important roles in craniofacial differences, yet mutations in enhancer sequences that underlie these differences remain poorly understood. This research project will benefit the scientific community, the general public, and individuals underrepresented in science and technology. First, the basic biology knowledge gained from this proposed work will be disseminated to audiences of varied technical expertise via journal articles, conferences, and print and social media. Second, this research will produce a database of DNA mutations that may be implicated in craniofacial disorders. Third, the proposed research will help our society learn about our distant ancestry. Specifically, it will address how DNA of Neanderthal origin, introduced into the genome of modern humans when our ancestors and Neanderthals interbred in ancient Eurasia, led to beneficial human adaptations and our increased risk of diseases. Finally, the fellow will mentor students underrepresented in science and technology in his research lab.   <br/><br/>To characterize nucleotide differences within enhancers that contribute to craniofacial differences across hominids via regulation of transcription factor binding, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression, the fellow will utilize Cranial Neural Crest Cells (CNCCs) and the Neanderthal genome. CNCCs are a relevant model for addressing this goal because CNCC derivatives become the embryonic face. Furthermore, the recent availability of the Neanderthal genome facilitates the study of human morphology and traits at a finer resolution, than comparisons to the chimpanzee. Using these systems, the fellow will employ an interdisciplinary strategy to identify enhancers that have evolved adaptively, to quantify the potency of enhancer variants on transcription exogenously, and to understand the effect of Neanderthal enhancers on CNCC behavior, and ultimately, morphology."

First, it will help to counter the excessive focus of research in cell and molecular biology on the animals, fungi, and land plants.  There is an enormous amount to be learned about the huge diversity of other interesting cell types, many of which are also ecologically and/or economically important.  Second, it will provide Chlamydomonas researchers not only with new biological insights but also with valuable research tools, such as improved methods for regulated transgene expression and synchronization of cell division.  These tools should be of value not only for basic research but also for biotechnology, particularly in the biofuels industry, which in turn could have benefits for fuel supplies and environmental conservation.  Third, it will support the research career of a very talented young scientist and help him to progress into an independent academic position.  Finally, it will help to support the involvement of undergraduates, high-school students, and public-school teachers in research, with special emphasis on the teachers because of the large numbers of students that they themselves then go on to teach.  Nearly all previously hosted students (including many from underrepresented groups) have gone on in STEM fields, and the teachers have all carried ideas and materials from the laboratory back to their classrooms.  These patterns should continue under the current project.<br/><br/>This project will exploit the evolutionary position and experimental advantages of the green alga Chlamydomonas to elucidate the still-obscure core mechanisms of cytokinesis, the final step in cell division.  The focus is on how cells can form division furrows in the absence of a ""contractile actomyosin ring"" (CAR).  The CAR is found in animals and fungi and is composed of actin filaments, type II myosin, and other proteins.  It has long been thought to provide the force for furrow ingression via an actin-myosin interaction like that in muscle.  However, many cells that normally have a CAR can divide without it, as can the vast number of cell types (such as Chlamydomonas) that form furrows but have no type II myosin; thus, there must be another driver(s) of furrowing.  To elucidate these mechanisms, several related aims will be pursued.  First, a combination of microscopic, biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic methods will be used to analyze the possible roles of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.  Second, a similar combination of methods will be used to explore the possibility that the primary driver of furrow formation is localized growth of the plasma membrane and extracellular matrix.  Third, unbiased and targeted genetic screens will seek mutants with specific defects in cytokinesis; characterization of these mutants should help to reveal the underlying mechanisms that drive furrow formation.  These studies should help to elucidate both the shared mechanisms underlying the seemingly diverse modes of cytokinesis in modern organisms and the evolution of these modern mechanisms from those of ancestral cells.  Several lines of evidence suggest that the ancestral and still-core mechanism of cytokinesis is the localized deposition of new cell membrane and extracellular matrix, and that the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons play auxiliary roles in this process.  Chlamydomonas is an attractive system in which to investigate these issues.  It is evolutionarily distant from the organisms on which cytokinesis studies have previously focused; divides by furrow formation but does not have a type II myosin; has one conventional actin, one unconventional actin, and a well developed microtubule cytoskeleton; displays an enrichment of both actin and microtubules around the cleavage furrow; and has many genetic tools already available.  Its mechanisms of cytokinesis have hardly been studied, and elucidating them should contribute to a needed paradigm shift in the cytokinesis field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many pathogens deliver effector proteins into their hosts to promote virulence of the pathogen. Over evolutionary time, the plant can evolve to recognize specific effector proteins from the pathogen. The PI's research group has identified a plant protein (a ""decoy"") that acts as a ""mousetrap"" for a pathogen effector protein, and enables the plant to mount a strong immune response. This work will determine the genetic parameters necessary for pathogen recognition in the host, in order to help design better decoys and protect crops from infection. This project includes substantial outreach to a local two-year college that serves a diverse student body, including underrepresented groups (37% Hispanic, 24% African American, 19% Asian, 1% Hawaiian) and underprivileged students (68% receive financial aid), in order to expose students to cutting-edge research and broader educational opportunities. <br/><br/>Dissection of the molecular determinants underlying host immunity will provide a rigorous toolkit to combat the significant problem posed by plant pathogens. HopZ1a, a Pseudomonas syringae type III secreted effector protein, is recognized indirectly through ZAR1, a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat containing receptor protein, when HopZ1a acetylates the ZED1 pseudokinase. ZED1 appears to be a decoy that has evolved to trap the T3SE into recognition, as it is not a functional kinase and does not have a role in basal immunity. This work will examine ZAR1 and ZED1 natural and mutant diversity in order to develop constraints for rational design of a pathogen decoy. The PI will collaborate with a local two-year college that primarily serves underprivileged students and underrepresented groups, and will host several students each summer to learn new scientific techniques. The lab will design a module on plant immunity that will be taught in the college. This will provide teaching opportunities for students and post-docs, and increase the participation of underrepresented groups in science. Together these efforts will encourage underrepresented students to pursue and excel at multi-disciplinary scientific research, provide outreach opportunities for graduate students and post-docs, and make progress on significant scientific and agricultural problems."

The instrument will be able to completely analyze complex mixtures of molecules in microbiomes and in rapidly changing chemical environments. The microbes that live on and within vertebrates play a critical role in metabolism, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their influence are not well understood. This instrument will allow simultaneous monitoring of many molecules produced by these microbes. The same instrumentation will also be adapted to detect important, short-lived chemical species.  These highly reactive species play central roles in many chemical reactions - for example, in flames and in the atmosphere - but many have never been directly observed. Developing this instrumentation will also provide an ideal arena for an interdisciplinary collaboration in which undergraduate and graduate students in physics, chemistry, and chemical biology will learn about the challenges and capabilities of each other's areas of science.  Overall, advancing this technology will add a powerful technique to the suite of chemical analysis tools currently available to the microbiology and chemistry communities.<br/><br/><br/>Detecting, identifying, and quantifying the complex mixtures of volatile, reactive molecules found in microbiomes and many other chemical environments is a challenging and important problem. A host of sensitive mixture analysis techniques exist today, but no technique can definitively analyze gas phase mixtures with hundreds of components, and many methods require laborious adjustment for each new species to be analyzed. The analysis of short lived, reactive species is a particularly difficult problem, as most separation techniques operate too slowly to observe such molecules. Fourier Transform Microwave Spectroscopy (FTMW) is exceptionally well suited to this challenging analysis problem. FTMW works by exciting and then detecting narrow, highly specific rotational (microwave) resonances in gas phase molecules. Fingerprints of distinct species can be separated electronically, and physical separation or purification of samples is not required, even for mixtures with hundreds of components. The new instrumentation leverages recent advances in microwave spectroscopy techniques, cryogenics, and fast electronics to dramatically increase the sensitivity of FTMW.  The cryogenic techniques used here further provide one of the most inert chemical environments ever achieved, allowing for the stabilization and detection of highly reactive compounds. These reactive compounds play critical roles in many chemical environments, despite lasting for a small fraction of a second under typical conditions. The instrumentation will be adapted to study both complex mixtures produced in microbiomes and reactive mixtures produced in rapidly changing chemical environments. This instrumentation will allow scientists to unravel chemical environments of previously unmanageable complexity, providing an important new tool for studying a wide range of important chemical and biochemical systems. <br/><br/>This award is being made jointly by two Programs- (1) Instrument Development for Biological Research, in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Biological Sciences Directorate), and (2) Chemical Measurement and Imaging, in the Division of Chemistry"

They are expected to learn fundamental and cutting-edge techniques relevant to studying DNA repair mechanisms in mammalian cells, including high-resolution imaging. <br/><br/>The chromatin response to DNA damage is highly dynamic and must be regulated to maintain the appropriate architectural organization that promotes high-fidelity DNA repair and preserves genomic integrity. How these chromatin structural dynamics are coordinated with DNA repair is not well understood. The PIs will develop multiplexing novel fluorescence correlation methods including pair correlation spectroscopy (pCF) and nanoimaging tracking techniques to analyze how DNA damage affects chromatin dynamics and how that in turn dictates DNA repair pathway choice. These phenomena will be investigated in response to relatively simple DNA breaks or complex DNA damage lesions induced in different cellular contexts. Aim 1 includes monitoring changes in chromatin access at the damage site, interrogating the relationship to DNA repair pathway choice, and determining responsible factors. Aim 2 involves high-resolution multiplexed analyses of chromatin dynamics at defined DNA double-strand break sites, and investigating the interplay between DNA repair and transcription. An overall goal is also to develop new methods that yield 4D and nanoscale views of chromatin dynamics in single mammalian cells when DNA is damaged, for a quantitative understanding of how the cellular machinery assesses the damage and decides how to repair its genome."

This research will involve a mixture of lab and field-based activities and will culminate with a student symposium that includes both oral presentations and a poster session.  <br/><br/>Over four years of funding, the program will award NSF fellowships to a total of 32 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities and from underrepresented populations. Student recruitment is primarily web-based but includes direct communication with undergraduate-serving institutions with high enrollment of underrepresented groups.  Several factors are considered important for student selection, including academic record, letters of reference, student interest in obtaining an advanced career in science, and diversity. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. <br/><br/>Program success will be assessed using a common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) as well as specific tools developed within the Pepperdine program.  Follow-through of the REU program will include presentations at regional and national meetings.   For more information about the program, students can visit the website (https://seaver.pepperdine.edu/surb/) where they can apply online.  In addition, students can contact the PI (Dr. Jay Brewster at jay.brewster@pepperdine.edu).

The first prediction is that by taking the relationships among different pathogen species and different hosts species that they infect into account, we will improve our ability to predict which plants can be affected by which pathogens in nature. This prediction will be tested with a variety of plants and their pathogens. The second prediction is that when a new plant species (such as a crop) is introduced into an area, pathogens that infect close relatives already growing there will be most likely to 'spill over' and affect the new crop. The last prediction is that because pathogens are less likely to spread between species that are not closely related, mixtures of crop species could be designed to reduce problems due to diseases in agriculture. In the process of testing these predictions, the researchers will develop new analytical tools for the study of plant disease. This work will aid in developing new strategies for protecting crop plants from disease, and for protecting other valuable plant resources. The large training component of this project will include high school classes, college classes, senior thesis students, and PhD students.  These students will learn skills from many fields that have both basic science and economic importance, including forest ecology, ecological monitoring, ecology of agricultural systems, ecological horticulture and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This project will test predictions regarding the relationship between phylogenetic relatedness of hosts and the host ranges of the pathogens that infect them. For each of the three components of the project, the researchers will take advantage of a previously developed and validated quantitative model that predicts how pathogen host ranges are constrained by the evolutionary relationships among host plants. In a novel application of network theory, the researchers will incorporate phylogenetic structure into network models for plant-pathogen interactions. They will use a metagenomics approach (identifying all fungal species growing inside plants by extracting and sequencing their DNA) to characterize the plant-pathogen networks of three plant communities, and will test predictions against the empirical networks. Novel hosts will be used in a transplant experiment in the field and an inoculation experiment in the laboratory to measure which local fungi colonize novel hosts, and how the phylogenetic structure of local plant-fungus networks affects fungal spillover to novel hosts. Finally, collaborating with a certified organic research farm, the PIs will test whether phylogenetically diverse cover crops have reduced disease pressure, a hypothesis called the ""Dilution Effect"", and whether greater phylogenetic distance among intercropped species suppresses disease."

This bacterium is maternally transmitted and is known to cause a variety of effects in the insect host including manipulation of reproduction and suppression of virus replication.  Because Wolbachia is capable of suppressing virus replication in insect hosts, it is being used to decrease the spread of human diseases (so-called ""pathogen blocking""). It is critical, therefore, to better understand how Wolbachia infects hosts and alters host cell biology.  Although Wolbachia infect upwards of 40% of insects on the planet, there is surprisingly little known about the exact mechanism used by the bacterium to manipulate its host.  This is largely due to the fact that Wolbachia occurs inside host cells and cannot be genetically manipulated presently.  This project will use a novel approach in this system to identify proteins used by the bacterium to alter host cell biology.  By identifying and characterizing these proteins, much will be learned about the basic biology of Wolbachia and the host cell components utilized during infection. Results will also lead to comparative analyses in other symbiotic systems. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science will be trained with project-based research related to this project on Wolbachia.<br/><br/><br/>The overarching scientific goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which an extraordinarily widespread bacterium interacts with its host.  Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular alpha-proteobacterium that forms symbioses with an extremely broad array of invertebrates, including isopods, nematodes, and insects.  Wolbachia is currently of interest with regards to vector control because mosquitoes harboring the bacterium are unable to transmit important human diseases. Because Wolbachia are not currently culturable or genetically tractable, little is known about the molecular basis of interaction with eukaryotic hosts.  Wolbachia encodes a type IV secretion system and is thought to secrete proteins (termed ""effectors"") into the eukaryotic cell to alter the biology of its insect hosts.  This project will use a powerful method to identify and study the biochemical function of probable effectors in Wolbachia.  The investigators will identify candidate effectors through genomics and  bioinformatics.  They will use a yeast genetic screen and a secretion assay in a heterologous system to further identify and characterize these candidates.  Finally, the researchers will investigate the biochemical function and cellular effects of these proteins in the Drosophila host.  These results will be the first comprehensive analysis of Wolbachia secreted substrates and will lead to significant advances in the Wolbachia field and comparative work in other symbiotic strains (such as those infecting filarial nemotodes)."

A major challenge for the 21st century, therefore, is to increase the yields of major crop plants, such as soybean, using state-of-the-art genetic technologies in order to increase food production using the limited amount of land available for growing crops. Seeds represent a major source of food for human and animal consumption. The experiments in this project will investigate seed differentiation in higher plants. The long-term objective of this project is to use state-of-the-art genomic technologies to uncover the gene regulatory networks, or DNA control circuits, required to ""make a seed."" There are several reasons that support the selection of soybean for this study. Soybean seeds are one of the largest sources of protein feed and vegetable oil in the world, providing $30 billion annually in farm value to the U.S.  Soybean seeds are uniquely suited to study the basic processes controlling seed development. Finally, there are enormous genetic resources for soybeans that will facilitate progress, including the availability of its entire DNA sequence. Undergraduates majoring in both science and humanities from three universities, including a historically African-American university, will also participate in this project in order to learn first-hand about the ""excitement of scientific discovery"" and the role crop genetic engineering plays in society.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify the gene regulatory networks that are responsible for controlling the differentiation and function of major soybean seed regions and subregions throughout development- including the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat. Chip-Seq experiments will be used to identify downstream gene targets and cognate DNA control elements of transcription factors (TFs) that are specific for each seed region and subregion from fertilization through maturation. Bioinformatic approaches will be used to construct regulatory networks that guide and control specific seed functions spatially during development. SELEX-Seq experiments will complement the Chip-Seq studies by identifying the DNA binding motifs for each region- and subregion-specific TF in vitro. Functional studies using a seed protoplast system will be used to perturb and validate TF gene targets identified with Chip-Seq in vivo. The significance of these experiments is that they will provide new insights into the gene circuits and cis-control modules that are important for ""making a soybean seed."" By understanding the DNA ""wiring"" required for the establishment of seed form and function, novel approaches can be designed for increasing seed yield and, therefore, food production."

Examples of these ""patchy"" environments include natural habitats like wetlands and human-managed habitats like agricultural fields. This project will test the idea that the number of different species (biodiversity) that can live in patches of habitat depends on the animals' ability to move between patches, the places where those patches occur, and the amount of food available in each patch.  Understanding what determines biodiversity is important because it allows one to predict and manage especially diverse, often vulnerable, patches of habitat.  Because it is practically impossible to rigorously test the determinants of biodiversity in natural areas, this project will take place in the laboratory. Researchers will create miniature, patchy worlds of very small animals that live in water to study what happens on much larger scales to animals in the real world. Experiments will focus on the relationship between the number of species, their dispersal abilities, and the amount of food available to them in small containers of water.  A complicated model will be built to help analyze the data and extend the results to different animals and different types of habitat patches. The laboratory experiments will also be used in teaching and outreach activities to provide opportunities for grade-school students and teachers to learn scientific methods and ecological concepts through hands-on experiences.  Both students and teachers will help design and carry out experiments, contributing directly to the scientific process.<br/><br/>The investigator will experimentally test whether a common feature of ecological systems -- dispersal among irregularly distributed habitats -- affects the stability of a fundamental ecological unit, the food web. Research will include experimental and theoretical components. Experiments conducted using protist microcosms will test hypotheses arising from network theory that: (1) food webs connected through randomly structured dispersal networks will show greater spatial asynchrony and network-wide stability than those connected in regular networks and (2) effects of dispersal will vary across a gradient in resource productivity, as this factor is known to alter food web stability. Experiments will be integrated with mechanistic models, extending the generality of project findings to broader contexts and advancing general food web theory. The research will also leverage the tractability of protist microcosms to provide inquiry-based curriculum content and student research projects in an undergraduate ecology course.  Students from groups currently underrepresented in science will be recruited and mentored in experimental design, data collection, analysis and presentation. Outreach activities will bring public school teachers into the investigator's laboratory and translate ecological research experiences into lesson plans aligned to Next Generation Science Standards."

Ant colonies operate without central control.  Ants use brief local interactions that in the aggregate, allow colonies to adjust to changing conditions. The project will continue a unique long-term study tracking a population of harvester ant colonies in the desert of the southwest US over 30 years, including periods of heavy rainfall and a long drought that now appears to be ending. Colonies regulate foraging activity in response to changes in food availability and water stress.  Colonies differ in how they regulate foraging; some are more likely than others to restrict foraging activity in dry weather so as to conserve water. The project will use genetic methods to find genetic differences among colonies that differ in behavior, to learn whether the regulation of foraging behavior is inherited from parent to offspring colonies, and to examine how colony behavior is associated with its reproductive success in numbers of offspring colonies. This work will show how natural selection is shaping the collective behavior of colonies, and how selection can shift in response to changing drought conditions.<br/><br/>Collective behavior occurs at every level of biological organization, from cells to animals. It operates without central control, using local interactions that in the aggregate produce a collective outcome. Natural selection on collective behavior, as on any trait, acts in relation to ecological pressures. The project investigates the evolution of collective behavior in a natural population, linking the individual and collective levels, how selection pressure on collective behavior shifts in changing ecological conditions. The project draws on and continues a 30-year study of the demography, behavior, ecology and evolution of a population of colonies of the red harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) in the desert of southwestern US, and develops a database that makes these data available for analysis. Previous work shows that desert harvester ant colonies regulate foraging activity to manage water stress, using brief olfactory interactions between outgoing and returning foragers inside the nest. Colonies vary in how they regulate foraging activity, and previous work conducted in drought conditions, shows this is associated with colony reproductive success in offspring colonies. The project examines how changing ecological conditions, especially rainfall, lead to shifts in the selection pressures that link foraging activity and reproductive success. Reduced representation genomic sequencing will be used to identify parent-offspring pairs of colonies, and thus measure reproductive success in number of offspring colonies. The heritability from parent to offspring colonies of the regulation of foraging will be investigated. A genome-wide association study will be conducted to investigate the genetic architecture underlying this variation in collective behavior.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pattern of species is so ubiquitous that the question of why this pattern occurs is often overlooked. Why has life not evolved into a single superorganism rather an array of species, or why has it evolved into discrete clusters rather than a continuum? Researchers who study the process called speciation aim to answer these fundamental questions. This project is one of the first of its kind to extend the research of speciation to viruses. Until recently, it was thought that viral diversity was arrayed along a continuum and did not coalesce into distinct species. New information on viral genetics has revealed that viruses do indeed form into distinct clusters. The researchers will use laboratory experiments and state of the art biotechnologies to determine how different biological variables affect viral speciation. This research will add to a general understanding of speciation, as well as to improve our understanding of the drivers of viral evolution. The researchers will design teaching modules for undergraduate students to learn about virus classification and speciation, while also contributing to virology research.<br/> <br/>In 2016, the researchers published a landmark paper in the journal Science where they reported observing a virus called bacteriophage lambda evolve into two new species. This was a unique observation because speciation was thought to take too long to observe during the course of a laboratory experiment and because at the time, it was debatable whether or not viruses formed into species. The research group is building on this previous result by determining how three biological variables ? genetic architecture, resource competition, and gene flow ? affect lambda?s speciation. To accomplish this, the researchers will employ synthetic biology technologies to measure the fitness landscape of lambda, computer programs to simulate and predict lambda evolution, and evolution experiments to test the predictions. In addition, an education module will be created to teach students in a course called Phage Hunters about viral speciation and species concepts. Phage Hunters is taught at universities worldwide and provides training through authentic research experiences. One of the goals of the module will be to have students perform research by discovering new viral species through bioinformatic analyses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

He called these 'coadapted gene complexes' and hypothesized they should be passed on to offspring as a unit. These units would keep certain beneficial combinations of genetic variation intact in the next generation. Today, genome sequencing technology allows research into whether coadapted gene complexes, also called 'supergenes', indeed control complex traits. One such trait that has inspired curiosity in humans is social organization. How are cooperative behaviors encoded in the DNA of social organisms?  Previous research found a large supergene associated with variation in a complex social trait in ants. This supergene contains units of more than 600 genes that are passed together as a unit to offspring. By contrast, most of the genome is shuffled from one generation to the next to ensure that offspring inherit different genetic variation from each parent. In multiple Formica ant species, individuals from colonies that consist of a single queen and her offspring have one variant of this supergene. Individuals from colonies that contain multiple queens have a different variant. The goal of this project is to learn how these supergenes appear and persist in groups of species, how they work, and how genes shape social behavior. This project will be an important step in understanding how and why supergenes form, and also in developing the link between genes and social behaviors. This project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate research training and introduce K-12 students to the study of social insects.<br/><br/>The PI and co-PI have recently identified two ant species that each carry three alternative variants of the supergene. This project will take advantage of one population of each species where three haplotypes co-occur. Using these populations, the researchers will characterize the variation among alternative haplotypes at the supergene and link that variation to functional differences. In particular, differences in phenotype and fitness will be investigated with a series of mating and brood rearing experiments. The experiments will include queens with each possible genotype in each species. Additionally, the gene order, recombination rates, and zones of suppressed recombination between alternative haplotypes will be assessed through high density linkage mapping and whole genome sequencing, in order to reconstruct their evolutionary history.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The theme of the REU is ""Integrating Biology from Molecules to Ecosystems."" The program offers research training in molecular biology, cell biology, developmental biology, physiology, and ecology. Evolution is central theme and inherent part of all research programs included in the program. Students will be able to conduct research in areas that could include anything from gene regulation and cell morphogenesis, to examining environmental factors that alter developmental trajectories in whole animals, to studying evolution in the field. In addition to the intensive research experience (with students mentored by faculty members and doctoral or postdoctoral students), the program offers an intensive week of introductory courses, a weekly research seminar presented by faculty members from across campus, writing and oral communication exercises, ethics training, a weekly professional development course, and a balanced social/recreational program. Students will assess the program by using the REU common assessment tool. The UCB REU program seeks students interested in pursuing graduate school and research careers in the biological sciences. Student applications are assessed by the PI, co-PI and training faculty.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that a total of 48 undergraduate students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. One of the program goals is to increase the number of women, underrepresented minorities, first generation students, students from low income backgrounds and students with disabilities who pursue graduate degrees in the biological sciences. Students in the program will learn how research is conducted, and enhance their skills and confidence to do science. Many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences, improving their chance to get into the most competitive graduate programs in the country. Further, the UCB REU program will strengthen ties with colleges and universities that serve the targeted student populations. <br/><br/>Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

One biological process that is responsive to such cues in microbes is sporulation. This produces spores, which are used for transport to new geographic areas or to survive unfavorable conditions. Many pathogenic microbes also use spores to infect their hosts. This project will examine the role of environmental signals such as light on sporulation, with a focus on a large and economically important group of plant pathogens known as oomycetes. Some of these species make spores upon exposure to light, but light represses spore formation in other species. This project will test the hypothesis that sporulation is regulated by interactions between a specific type of photoreceptor protein and other components of the cell's regulatory machinery, such as those that activate or repress the activity of genes. The project will also explain at a molecular level why different species respond divergently to light. The research also has the potential for a practical return, since knowing what regulates sporulation can lead to the development of inhibitors of sporulation that will protect crops from disease. The project integrates research with education and outreach in communities with high minority demographics.<br/><br/>In Phytophthora, a genus of plant pathogenic oomycetes, light stimulates sporulation by root pathogens but represses sporulation by foliar pathogens. This ensures that spores of root-infecting species appear above the soil line so that they can spread to new hosts, and that spores of foliar pathogens appear at night to avoid desiccation or UV damage. The goal of the research is to learn how these divergent responses to light evolved, using the root pathogen P. capsici and the foliar pathogen P. infestans as models. One objective is to use RNA-seq to characterize the effects of light on gene expression in the two species, and identify functional elements within light-induced promoters. A second objective is to study the role of cryptochromes on sporulation. These photoreceptor proteins are distributed widely in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and have been shown to regulate growth, development, and metabolism. Their function in P. capsici and P. infestans will be examined using gene silencing, overexpression, heterologous expression, and protein-protein interaction studies. Having divergent responses to light within a single genus presents a unique opportunity for studying the evolution of an important developmental process. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the research, which will be integrated with programs for increasing student success and interest in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. The goal of this project is to understand the role of group size in the evolution of self-organization in ant colonies. Across social insects, larger colony sizes are associated with greater organizational complexity, but we still don't know how enlarging group size causes this pattern. Colony organization may result from natural selection to reduce potential gridlock of large groups, targeting individual behaviors or the shape of the colony's nest, both of which may govern interactions. Alternatively, complex organization may instead be a beneficial by-product of increasing group size. The fellow will test these hypotheses by comparing species of ants with different colony sizes. The findings from this research will help elucidate the evolutionary forces structuring groups more generally, from cell aggregations to animal societies. The fellow plans to broaden participation of under-represented groups by partnering with teachers at her former schools to create classroom workshops in which students collect data for this project, thereby creating opportunities for underrepresented K-12 students to participate directly in research, and will extend the same outreach opportunities to other minority-serving LA public schools partnered with UCLA's MESA School Program. <br/><br/>The project has three, interrelated objectives that examine how colony organization has evolved in response to increasing group size. First, the fellow will distinguish whether increasing colony size leads to costly versus beneficial changes by enlarging the groups of small-colony ant species (Temnothorax) and comparing them to naturally large colony species of equivalent size (Tapinoma, Linepithema). Second, the fellow will determine the contribution of nest architecture in structuring colony organization by housing colonies in subdivided or single-chambered nests. To facilitate comparison between distantly related ant species in the above objectives, the fellow will generate standardized metrics of (1) colony organization from social networks of nutrient flow and (2) colony functionality by assessing how well foragers respond to the nutritional needs of the entire colony. The fellow will learn to fluorescently label these nutrients and track them within the colony using computer vision. Third, the fellow will investigate which aspects of nest architecture have been adapted for large colony size. The fellow will lead k-12 students in to complete this final objective by allowing classroom ant colonies of various sizes to excavate nests in observable structures. The fellow will use the classroom ant colonies to facilitate educational workshops that will be targeted to help satisfy national teaching standards in STEM fields (NGSS) at the appropriate grade level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research will be valuable for better understanding the role of males in caring for offspring in species in which both males and females care for young. Few studies have been conducted on paternal care, relative to maternal care, and many of the studies on paternal care were conducted in species in which only females care for young, making it difficult to gauge their ecological relevance. Before, during, and after giving birth, females undergo neural and hormonal changes that increase maternal care, in part by increasing attraction to sensory stimuli from newborns. The fellow will examine whether similar patterns occur in new fathers by assessing their responsiveness to newborn sensory cues and exploring the relative importance of acoustic and olfactory cues for eliciting paternal care. This work could provide insights into the normal expression of parental care as well as, conversely, maladaptive parent-offspring interactions. Findings can also help improve conservation efforts for critical populations. Because human activities can interfere with acoustic and olfactory communication in many endangered species, they may also interfere with parental behaviors. This research will provide valuable training for the fellow, and support efforts to increase the participation and career persistence of underrepresented minorities in science. <br/><br/>The fellow will test the hypothesis that the onset of paternal care in the monogamous, biparental California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) will be associated with increased attraction and altered neural responses to olfactory and auditory stimuli from pups. To test this hypothesis, the behaviors and neural responses of un-mated males, expectant fathers and new fathers will be compared. First, males behavior in response to pup odors and/or vocalizations will be quantified. Neural activity will be measured in brain regions associated with olfaction, audition, parental behavior, reward and/or fear by measuring the expression of an immediate-early gene product, Fos. Lastly, the hormonal control of behavioral and neural responses to pup stimuli in males will be examined. Through this research, the fellow will learn techniques in behavioral neuroendocrinology and will actively recruit undergraduate assistants through programs aimed at providing research training to underrepresented minorities, resulting in mentorship of at least nine undergraduates. This research will also be used to generate open-access, app-based lessons to improve science literacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow that will increase the participation of groups underrepresented in biology. This research will investigate the spread of antibiotic resistance, which is a rising threat to society, affecting both low-and high-income countries alike. While the global spread of antibiotic resistance is readily observed, the transfer of antibiotic resistance at the household scale is not well understood. The Fellow will explore how antibiotic resistance genes propagate between humans, animals, and the environment in low-and middle-income countries at the household level. This project will identify the most important environmentally-mediated pathways for the transfer of antibiotic resistance between hosts. The knowledge obtained from understanding how antibiotic resistance spreads can be used to better devise policy, engineering controls, and suggest behavior to combat antimicrobial resistance. To increase minority participation in the biological sciences, the Fellow will incorporate antibiotic resistance and genomics in a teaching module to be used in local community colleges in Boston. The goal of this module is to expose students to research and introduce them to scientific challenges that face our society today. <br/><br/>Antibiotic resistance can spread through two main mechanisms: propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria and transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. This research aims to characterize both mechanisms of resistance spread in environmental transmission pathways (between humans, water, animals, soil) using recently developed metagenomic tools. Long and short read sequencing will be used to obtain strain-level information on antibiotic resistant bacteria. Additionally, complimentary methods (qPCR) will be used to identify key reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes by quantifying the abundance of genes in different household samples (humans, animals, water, soil). Beyond this research, the Fellow will develop and implement a teaching module for community colleges centered around sequencing. Not only will community college students learn about the latest sequencing techniques, but also the data they collect will directly contribute to a crowd-sourced database that maps antibiotic resistance in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
